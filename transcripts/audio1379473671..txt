Speaker 0:  Hey. How are you doing, Ethan?
Speaker 1: Doing excellent, Paul. How are you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Good. Thanks. Let me just connect my my headphones. One one moment.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 0: I've just gone from my device to computer. One minute. And there we go. That oop.
Speaker 1: Publish, it'd be it.
Speaker 0: Great. How you doing?
Speaker 1: Can you hear me? I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Sorry. That was did did you hear that I said you were frozen yet?
Speaker 1: No. I didn't hear that.
Speaker 0: No. Okay. Sorry. Your the the internet just was it just froze and it went unstable. So yeah. Let me know. Well, on yeah. Let's just see how we go because I've I've just moved to the end of the End of the house working from home and Yeah. And I I don't know whether you know or you visited Australia, but the internet compared to Europe and even Columbia and South America is just rubbish.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Really?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. For for a country that you know, first world country. It's it's pretty crap. But, you know, in its defense, it's a huge country. Okay. But even so, you know, there's there's kind of, you know, small sick well, you know, relatively kind of, you know, contained cities by the coast that you would have thought they'd be able to figure this stuff out. But yeah. No. I I'm always amazed like I travel to places that you know, a so called third world or, you know, developing countries. And, you know, their internet's just super fast.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you expect that. No. But anyway No.
Speaker 0: I see. Yeah. It's a beautiful country, you know, that respect. So I'm originally from London. So
Speaker 1: Oh, no.
Speaker 0: I'm I'm not Australian.
Speaker 1: Oh, wow. I'm actually going to London on the nineteenth.
Speaker 0: Of April?
Speaker 1: Yeah. No problem.
Speaker 0: Because I'm I'm there from this I'm out there sixteenth of May. Oh. When do you leave? You just there for
Speaker 1: a few weeks? Just there for the weekend. For a mastermind event.
Speaker 0: Oh, a weekend in a mastermind event. Wow. That's that's some trap from Cape Town. Cape Town to London.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Incredible.
Speaker 0: How cool. What what's well, who's the the group or the the, you know, who who are you seeing? Yes. Who who you're a part of?
Speaker 1: I've got quite a few coaches in terms of business or
Speaker 0: -- Yeah. --
Speaker 1: mentors like advisors. This one is for a a very similar business to mine, similar model -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: but they're just doing a lot more in terms of, like, half a million a month. So I like to learn from them, good friends of mine. So we just go there for the last month. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Hey, Ethan, you you're so switched on me. That that is the way forward. Seriously, you know, it's like getting you know, a bit a lot further ahead in my journey compared to to where you are in age and stuff and and maybe the business. But you know, it's the one way to get ahead and you're obviously doing it, you know it, you know, is is, you know, those people that are a few steps ahead just meant, you know, mirror them and and just see, you know, if you can, just, you know, listen to them and see where where you know, you can improve or or the one, you don't make the mistakes that they make because everybody makes mistakes. And if you can avoid, you know, the the the kind of big ones, then you, you know, you're gonna get yourself ahead.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. Hundred percent. I agree completely. And a mistake say, it's the time, really, the the time gap between not knowing and knowing. That's what I really wanna see.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. That that's that's the, you know, that that's the thing that and and I'm I'm certainly I'm up for learning as much as you can about something. But, you know, sometimes, you know, you do need outside help and other times, you know, things just take the time to to to learn and experiment. And and I can imagine your job is is certainly where you need to try things and, you know, or that they plateau and you need to, you know, change things up.
Speaker 1: You can't keep doing the same thing. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. But yeah. Yeah. It's gonna
Speaker 0: be No. I'm I'm it's really cool. And you know, just to give you a bit of bit of feedback. Yeah. I really enjoyed the way you conducted that meeting last week as well. Just in the way that you structured it and, you know, and and I I obviously from my business. So, you know, I'm the the person that's speaking to clients, selling the business, selling the the the kind of value and so forth. And, you know, I just thought the way that you you put that together in a in a way that kind of, you know, shaped the the meeting was was really good.
Speaker 1: I appreciate it. I always I always like the feedback. And I -- Mhmm. -- I really appreciate it too because, I mean, learning is the ultimate goal, to be honest. So anything that can help you about moving in. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No worries at all. Let's dive into this because I've the reason I I moved this was I've just gotta get away at about ten to seven, quarter to seven. So, yeah, let let us know how how you go
Speaker 1: hundred percent and before the Internet cuts out. So I thought the best way to start with this call is just to recap what we spoke about on the last one just to make sure on the same page that everything's clear. And then assuming everything
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Yes. -- I'll go into the actual proposal. So I'll stop by going through ton of case studies, our exact process, and then all the other details and then answer any questions that you might have. Is that okay with you? It sounds good. Yeah. Perfect. Alright. Cool. So like in the last call, we discussed that The goal really at this point is to sign two clients per month. Right? It can go higher, get a little, but that is the main goal. And the only thing stopping you from signing these two clients per month, three, four clients, whatever it might be, is speaking to more qualified prospects every single day. That need what you're offering and that can afford what you're offering. And like on the last one, you clearly have all the foundations ready. You have capacity and you're ready to sign more clients. You have case studies, you work with some of the best brands in Australia. You have a great team, You guys can convert, you can sell. Your clients love you like you have everything that needs to be there, beverage. All we need to do is just get you in contact with more brands that can afford what you're offering that need what you're offering. And if you can just speak to them every single day, you know, I'm I'm very certain that you'll be able to at least sell a few of them every single month. Yes. I'm reasonably close to your situation.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's exactly. And and just just one thing though that that might, you know, might be a little bit different from the the software company that you're working with. Mhmm. Just in the fact that that kind of the the work that we do, a lot of people want, you know, they they want Australian companies to work with Australian companies. They want, you know, I'd I'd find it quite a quite hard at at our present scale even though the teams in Europe for a UK company, for example, to to to work with us. That's not to say that they wouldn't. And, you know, I have worked with UK companies in the past, but there's been through recommendations and and my network rather than, you know, coming to us against, you know, three different companies say because most of our our clients would would, you know, get three to four quotes or or look at three three companies. And and I'm hoping that, you know, the way although this is cold outreach, you know, that that you know, people feel that, you know, they they may not need to do that in this process, but but certainly the bigger clients that we're looking at, we would be looking to get three quotes. And and if there's two companies that are similar to us and they're based in the UK and they're a UK client, they're gonna go with them. So I that's just a a kind of heads up to you and a a war not not a warning, but a kind of, you know, in in that I think we do need to focus on Australian clients and as our bread and butter.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's perfectly fine. Why do you or quickly, why do you think it is that they prefer to go with a UK or European company, for example? I
Speaker 0: think because of the because of the size of the the kind of contract, the fact that you'd be working together for a long time, it it's not a it's not a commodity yet, although some people would might say it is. But it's it's certainly the, you know, they they wanna if anything goes wrong and they they they want you to come meet them face to face or they want you to be at least on the same time zone and and being able to get on a flight for an hour if you're based in Germany say or wherever. You know? So it's yeah. Those are the reasons. And I think Australia is such, you know, cut off, you know, sometimes it doesn't feel like it, you know, it's a very modern country, but but certainly, you know, just in in time zones and geographically it's cut off from Europe.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, that's perfectly fine. That's perfectly fine. You know, honestly, it could even be a a competitive advantage because, you know, not many people actually reach out to Australia in the first place. Australian brands. So ninety percent of our clients are from Europe, U. S. Canada, for example, and they prefer -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: example targeting UK, US, Canada as opposed to Australia, New Zealand, things like that. So The way I see there'll be a lot less competition for Sunlight is able to reach out to these Australian brands. If your goals would just go for them initially, And then easily, we could just expand to international beyond that.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Well, that that that would be great. And as I said to you, I'm not opposed to having a, you know, a so called UK office and and certainly a UK somebody there answering the phone as as a employee of Fuze mobile. And yeah. So, you know, that that can certainly happen. The states I always find is a, you know, a hard nut crack because of, again, the size of it and maybe the competitive nature. But certainly, you know, there's this I'm open. I'm open to to expanding the business. And and certainly, my my CTO who who's pretty much a partner in in the business based in Poland with the development team. We are, you know, he's ready to, you know, he's ready to go for it.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. And the last point I wanna mention before we go to the actual proposal is we've had situations like this before, not necessarily in software development. But in other or with other marketing agencies. And what they found is that to the prospect, their business and all the others looks like commodity like you were saying, they look exactly the same. And because of that, prospects would, you know, get five, ten quotes of other agencies, see what they're charging, and they just pick the lowest one. And that's obviously not the lowest we go about it. But What we found is that if we're able to position you or differentiate what you're doing as opposed to everyone else, email that's unique that can stand out, that looks different from everyone else, then you're not seen as a commodity anymore, and you're, you know, selling in a pool of one. Right? You're the unique -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- that that's so important. That that is and and that's something I'm working on in in everything in in the way that I talk to people, the way that we engage, the way that we put proposals together, the way that we talk about what we do, you know, that it isn't about software development, it's about the value. And I had that with a client this week, you know, it it was, you know, he was trying to talk to me, you know, that, you know, things that kind of, you know, you know, blown out a little bit in the scope. And and, you know, it's pretty much down to him changing the scope. But I was like, look, just think about the value. You're you're gonna be selling this business, you know, in a year, two years time for millions. And he and he really is that's not being being unrealistic. And I'm like, you know, you're quibbling over, like, you know, ten, twenty, thirty k. It's like it really isn't it's not a big difference. You know, it's it's not gonna make a big big difference to you in a in a year, two years time. So so that's the kind of conversations I have with people and and trying to position ourselves as as Yeah. It's something of of value and and that value is is, you know, certainly,
Speaker 1: you're gonna see that in your ROI. Hundred percent. Because ultimately, you know, it's an uphill battle if we're just trying to compete with other agencies in there. Know, just given quotes. But if we can be seen as a completely unique solution, then there's really no competition at the end of the day.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And just to your point there and I won't expand on it too much. But I've personally been thinking about, look, how do we kind of change that? You know, even even, you know, we've been known as Fuze Mobile for twelve years and and Mobile was, you know, was that big platform shift that happened twelve, thirteen, fourteen years ago. And I've just been thinking, look, do we do we have a little bit of a name change there and and, you know, keep the fuse element. But but really, you know, it's an innovation studio. It's say, you know, it's a product studio rather than being a a software developer. So that that's my thinking in in how we position ourselves. Hundred percent.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool. And that's some this is something we go into a ton of detail for all of our clients. The first step in our process, and I'm gonna go through it right now, is actually offer creation. So how can we position your business in a way that stands out allows you to potentially charge more, book more meetings, increase a close percentage, everything that comes with being a unique solution. So I'll just share my screen quickly. We can actually go through this. Yeah. Sure. Alright. Cool. Can you see this clearly?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Can. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright. So all welcome how to add an extra fifty to a hundred k a month to your agency within six nine months by integrating our client acquisition machine. So in this quick call, what I wanna do is, firstly, share how to customize your client acquisition and agency growth, the three step system to add an extra fifty hundred k a month without ad spend, problems that may be preventing you from predictably signing clients and booking sales calls. Our exact system outline so you could genuinely do this with or without us. Unique lead generation and client acquisition knowledge found through thousands and thousands of split tests that you can't find online, except on my YouTube channel, How marketing agencies exactly like yours? Pretty easily add fifty to a hundred k a month within six to nine months? What to do first and why? And then a quick bonus at the end, so stick around. And what I wanna show up by doing is firstly sharing some quick case studies of other agencies we've helped. Just so you can get an idea of what we do, how it works, things to that degree. So first one, my good friend, Charlie Morgan. If you're on YouTube, you might know who he is. You're able to scale to two point eight million per year, two hundred thirty five k a month using only outreach. Right? And The reason I'll bring them up is because we did a lot of work together, but because we'd be using the exact same systems for you, And it just shows what's possible without paid advertising, paid acquisition, things to that degree, and how effective it can be. Another one working with Ricky share. All things
Speaker 0: Sorry, Ethan. Can I just ask you a quick question there? With with Charlie, just sorry. Can you just go back to
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: That so you scaled that within what time time frame?
Speaker 1: So this was in about, say, a year and two months. That's incredible. Charlie is an absolute
Speaker 0: And and sorry. What what does Charlie do? Just just to be clear.
Speaker 1: Yep. So, Charlie, what is he ran with the agency the past, and then he converted to selling a, what do I say, a program or mentorship on how to do that, on how to scale your agents. So -- Yeah. Sure.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: because that his back end operations are extremely efficient, which is why it's able to increase revenue by this amount in this sort of time frame.
Speaker 0: Yes. So just getting clear on what you guys worked on. So you you worked on the agency and then the the kind of changeover to his his kind of content or course, whatever he was doing.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So we came in straight when he was doing the new course.
Speaker 0: Right? We didn't -- Okay. Gotcha. --
Speaker 1: initially, it was just for the course.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No. Amazing. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Cool. So another on ricochet Holdings. Kenny Stevens, he has from five hundred thousand followers. There is a Russell Branson. He runs an eight figure holding company slash growth agency. He is also in terms of his project size, also very similar to yours, except with e commerce brands specifically. So he's charging, you know, fifty hundred k hundred and fifty k potentially even in the first three months for the type of deals that he works with. So that's what's pretty similar to yours. Gaurav Fred, he's building eight figure affiliate marketing systems from e commerce brands, Zach, he is the founder of FlexLabs that we're talking about in the last form. Is size -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: business. The first is straight, you know, paid acquisition, email marketing as well, CRO, or combined into one service. But then also the delay. So it's charging -- Yep.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: two hundred three hundred k per project, building out apps for e commerce brands, Yep. That much for the degree. He's also also a legend. Right? We've got Chris running a seven figure e commerce growth agency, John Bullied seven figure on systems for agencies. I'll go through these quickly because I want you to be on this call all day. Scott Austin, seven hundred and forty k in the pipeline generated for his new company, and What I really wanna emphasize here is before and after. Because, obviously, these are cool. You know, that's great. But What you're gonna notice is there is a reoccurring theme across all of our clients and is that they're great at what they do. Right? They've grown from a forest which indicates the clients love them. They're able to sell. They're able to deliver. They just don't have a predictable way of getting in contact with these ideal prospects every single day. That's it.
Speaker 0: So they're trying to Let's even go back to so the guy that was with Richard Bronson that's got the sorry. Russell Bronson that's got the Yeah. Yeah. So Kenny Stevens. So he had a growth agency as and and that's as in kind of, you know, working with other companies growing there kind of online. Yeah. Yeah. Is this I assume?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So what he still has the growth agency. He just has multi multiple areas of the company. So Ricochet Holdings is actually a holding company. And he has the growth agency in there, which is growing e commerce reps using paid acquisition. Then he has -- Yep.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: obviously, an acquisition portion of it. So he's actually investing in e commerce businesses. And then he has ones where he partners with them. So he has, you know, yeah, just much bigger involvement into it. It becomes upon the portion of the business, and that's where the big projects really come from.
Speaker 0: And how long you've been working with him him with info?
Speaker 1: I've only been working with Kenny for around six months at this point. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Cool. That's no. So it's it's it's some great great people you've got there.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And and kind of, you know, really interesting. It seems that they they kind of quite you know, they they're developing their personal brand and you know, it and that's working and and I'm certainly not opposed to that. Have you found that that's worked for them, you know, Or do you find that that's the kind of way forward in in the way that they're they're building other areas of their business? Or or do you think that you that's not necessary to to to grow the, you know, the development agency say?
Speaker 1: That is a great question. And It's not necessary, and the foundation of a a good business as you definitely understand is, obviously, firstly, a great service, a great delivery. But I will say in acquisition, having a brand is like a force multiplier on everything. Yeah. That's true. The same reason why I post content, it's the same reason why I saw you on LinkedIn posting. You had a great post today? Yep. And the same reason I've both had YouTube. Yep. Because
Speaker 0: Yeah. Now I've I've I'm really stepping it up in in that respect. Only focusing on on LinkedIn at the moment and and we'll move over to Twitter. But -- Yeah. -- yeah. I I think I said, you know, there's there's a newsletter that that I'll be doing on -- Yeah. -- how to start an AI company, you know, software company. And that that'll be just interviewing founders, you know, rather just being a, like, all the others out, the million others out there that are just taking a a kind of, you know, aggregating what what news is out there. I I really wanna talk to all these kind of founders of the build building AI tools and and just really dive a little bit deeper into into that. So, yeah, there's there's certainly areas that I'm looking to to kind of not branch off to. They're all connected a bit like, you know, these entrepreneurs that you're you're dealing with. Yeah. But obviously, I need the the engine of the the agency to drive, you know, the the kind of repeatable sales and the cash flow to be able to do the things that I wanna
Speaker 1: do. That's a great point. And what we've found and I'm gonna go into more detail on how we do this in the actual process in a minute. But obviously you have the great service. And any sort of content that you do, like I said, it's a force multiplier on the actual outbound that we do. So if it's also to your point of the differentiation, It's also how he differentiates us out because if one person's providing tons of value upfront in terms of LinkedIn post, Twitter posts, YouTube posts, and giving it out all for free, And then they messaged you. Compared to everyone else who has no social presence at all, they're gonna go for the ones who's provided the value. Yeah. Exactly. Because one, they truss actually done it, and they just wanna reciprocate everything that, you know, that's given in the first time.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Well, they they they feel they feel that kind of you you know, they feel that trust and they also feel that they get to to know you or your style or your, you know, what you stand for really, which is vital in in kind of a relationship business.
Speaker 1: Exactly. So if If one of the reasons why they choose a UK company over your company is trust, then we can get that trust before even speaking to them, leveraging Gong.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No. Absolutely. Absolutely. Certainly can. Yeah. Yeah. And and I just think that side will take time. I mean, that I just wanted to kind of, you know, say that, yeah, that that side that that side will take a little bit of time in in, you know, businesses outside of Australia, but but certainly, yeah, that that's where I see it heading, Ethan. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And we'll show you exactly how we do it and how the other clients do it as well. So you can actually get a ton of the outcomes with very minimal inputs because obviously, you're busy, you have other things to do and you don't wanna be, you know, making YouTube videos all day.
Speaker 0: So No. But but I'm I'm certainly not not opposed to to really up in my my content claim.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. And then, yeah, just to recap on Austin, And again, we're seeing the same things over and over. They tried lead gen agencies. They tried, you know, buying leads, working with services that provide leads to them every month. They just don't see the results that they need. And then after work with us, you know, able to add next twenty four k in revenue, it should be a lot more at this point. It's just not updated. And he's focused solely on service delivery, managing his team and seeing predictable growth. Another one, Daniel, two hundred and twenty eight k in sales Right? This guy is amazing in under thirty days while training a sales team. And again, I'll go through them quick because you see the same thing over and over and over. Growing purely on referrals great service, no predictable sales process. So able to solve but nobody to solve to. They just lack in a system to speak to the qualified prospects gonna fold what they're offering every single day. And once we solve this one problem, this one problem, two hundred twenty eight k in under thirty days. Jeff, same thing. Resync, same thing. Waco, very similar. And then some of the biggest names in the space, Kinkadeau, e com growers on track, above fire. All seven figure marketing agencies. Right? So who is this actually for? Because we at this point, we turned down, we'll agencies that we take on. It's for established b to b marketing agencies with existing results and happy clients. Right? For agencies who don't have a systematic, predictable method of booking meetings and signing clients who rely on referrals for their growth. And again, founders and CEOs who have tried outreach by themselves, by hiring someone else, by working with the lead gen company, but still aren't getting the results that they need. So as for agencies who have a great service, the systems take on clients and the ability to sell, but no way of booking the calls with the qualified prospects in the first place. And then filed since she has got willing and able to add an extra fifty hundred k a month while transitioning from working in the business to working on the business. So what is actually stopping your growth? Right? You can simply add an extra fifty, hundred k by getting more projects, signing more clients, but what stops most agencies? Right? Why don't people just do that? They're just not speaking to enough qualified prospects on a daily based That is it. But the problem is that you as the founder, you as a CEO, you won't have enough time to do this yourself because You have a team to manage. You have clients to manage. You have all these other things. So the only other options that you have is hiring an employee that knows high level sales and marketing. And if they're no high level sales and marketing, they most likely have their own businesses or they cost millions beyond salaries. Then option two, you can hire a lead gen agency or freelancer or, you know, one of these lead gen services that don't really have your best interests at heart because they just wanna send you some bookings, get paid, and hope for the best, and most likely won't even deliver So this is why growth partnering is really the only viable option for marketing agencies to really scale up. Because growth partner combines the high level sales and marketing, because we do this for ourselves and for our clients as well, plus aligned incentives. We don't just wanna send you some bookings and hope for the best. We want you to generate revenue. We want you to sign clients. We want you to sign quality clients that you actually wanna work with. And retain. Plus, without costing millions billions salaries, we actually guarantee results. So what I quickly wanna walk you through are the three steps that I recommend to actually increasing revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within around sixty nine months And step one is called prepare the vessel, set the foundations for hybrid growth. Step two is launching the machine, the client acquisition system, and step three is the ultimate of conversion turning interest into revenue. So like we spoke up before in terms of the offer, Right? What I have on the left is the old way of doing things and the old outcome, what most agencies do in GET. And the new way of doing things what we recommend and the new outcome, what our but our clients are getting what we do and how it works. So the old way of doing things is collecting case studies through text. So what means is messaging your client on asking what results they got and putting it on a website. And the thing is you put in all this work to deliver insanely good results, and I know you guys deliver such great results just for prospects to not be able to relate to it or for prospects to think it's fake. Because anyone can just put numbers on a website. Anyone can just fake something. So what you get is you're putting in all this work just for the case studies to not have the potency that you needed to have. So what we recommend for you, for our clients as well, is case study video interviews. And what this is is either you or someone on our team gets onto calls with your past clients, figure out whether work before working with you, whether or after work you and what you did to bridge that gap. So what you get is a highly, highly engaging and incredibly relatable sales asset. That we can leverage before a call, after a call on your LinkedIn, on your website, or anywhere that's gonna pre sell prospects on autopilot so that when they actually do get onto a call, they already know you. They like you and they trust you. Just like we were speaking about earlier, this is how we can leverage media to do ramp it yourself from all the other agencies up in the same thing. And I can't explain how useful, how valuable these case video are. Second thing here, using a commodity offer. So what this is is, obviously, you know all the other development agencies And to the prospect, unfortunately, you may look like everyone else. Even though you like delivering such an amazing service, to the prospect, you just look like everyone else. So you get no interest when you are doing some sort of outreach. You get no interest. You get treated as a commodity. You get, you know, compared with other quotes. And it's just difficult, it's an uphill battle. So what we like to do is start by creating an irresistible offer around what you're already doing. Which will allow you to be seen as extremely unique, allow you to stand out, allow you to book more meetings, allow you to increase your close percentage, and most importantly not be seen as a commodity. Compared to everyone else. And then, thirdly, no profile social proof. So the same with the offer. If you look like everyone else, you're just gonna get what everyone else gets. So, you know, if you're doing outreach on LinkedIn, if you're doing it through email and you have no brand presence, again, you're just gonna get them interest. So you you already started with this. You're doing a phenomenal job on LinkedIn, you know, creating that brand, creating that presence, building that trust at scale, So this is something we just help to amplify. We just get you to, you know, make it more efficient, make it more effective, which will allow you to generate more inbound leads generate higher interest, bold trust, at scale, and pre sell prospects before the call so that everyone that does get on to a call is as warm as humanly possible at the time. So step two is launching the machine. And the old way of doing things is very simple. It's for relying on referrals and inbound for growth. And we all know how this is. It's it's unpredictable. It's sporadic, it gives owners anxiety to win or get new cash flow because the business is stagnate or shrink. And you have to work with subpar clients just, you know, get cash flow in the door. You just have to take wherever it comes to you. They may not even be in your in your niche, they might not even fetch your ICP. They might not even be your ideal client. But, you know, sometimes you just have to take them on. So The new way and what we recommend for you and for our clients as well is multi account and multi domain LinkedIn and email outreach. With a dedicated sales team that we hire, manage, train, all of that to convert replies into bookings. And to just go into a bit more detail on that, the reason that we do multi account and multi domain, is it because is because it's incredibly scalable? So if we find that you're signing a two it's a month and you say Ethan. Okay. Let's ramp things up. The team's ready. Let's go to four. Let's go to six. Let's go to ten. It's really just a matter of duplicating what's already working. Right? We don't have to read Can
Speaker 0: I just understand sorry, Ethan? Just just with a multi account LinkedIn outreach Could could you just clarify what that means?
Speaker 1: Sure. So it purely means outreach on multiple LinkedIn accounts.
Speaker 0: Okay. So so that we outreach from, you know, as if it's coming from our company or from how would that work?
Speaker 1: Correct. It'll be completely structured as it's coming from your company. So, yeah, very simply, it would just be, for example, key members of your company sending outreach and booking the appointments.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool.
Speaker 1: Yep. Alright. Cool. So the same with email. Just to clarify, they're the same email will all be from, you know, a representative of your company. Everything's in house. Yeah. Unless, for some reason, you wanted to be an external company that can be done too. But what we found best results, your company, And again, multi accounts and multi domain because, you know, if we want to scale up, if you wanna book, you know, sign four clients a month, ten clients a month, It's just a matter of getting either more accounts or more domains and hitting the exact same KPIs with these accounts and scaling up. Again, like I said, we hire, we train, and we manage a day. Don't
Speaker 0: you feel I mean, from your experience and and the results, you're seeing that it is predictable. Is that for for, you know, other clients' views
Speaker 1: in terms of Are we
Speaker 0: able to scale up in terms of scaling up to, you know, if I said to you after the third month that we're we're hitting one to two, that's great. Wanna hit three to four, you know, leads. Is is that Is that achievable?
Speaker 1: That's a great question. And not to get ahead of myself, but obviously, I'll initial packages, and I'll talk about the pricing at the end. But the initial packages are what they are. But then for many clients who stay on for after certain few months, they do wanna scale up, and then that is our secondary package and tertiary package where they we offer scaling options, if you know what I mean. So we can just double, triple, quadruple the volume if that's the goal. But at that point, I've already made a significant ROI and they're like, yeah. Let's just ramp things up. Sure. Okay.
Speaker 0: Good to hear.
Speaker 1: Yep. And it it really is that simple. I know a lot of, you know, potential agencies, legion, people they they over complicate things, but it really just If the exact system is just duplicated, we should expect to see the exact same outcomes. So if you're booking twenty meetings a month using this system, and we just duplicate it to another. If we're not seeing forty meetings a month collectively, then something something's wrong. Right? Mhmm. We're very we're very numbers focused, especially my partner. But anyway, he's it's like a robot. But yeah. I like it also. We hire, train, and manage a fully dedicated sales team that does all these bookings replies for you. So that genuinely all we need to do is hop on to calls with interested prospects that know you like you and trust you, that wanna buy what you're offering and sell them on it. And again, systematic predictable growth. Most importantly, you choose exactly who you want to work with. Right? You set the qualification tier if you want to work with only established brands that have the money for making six, seven figures, that's our target. And again, it's incredibly scalable.
Speaker 0: Yep. Okay.
Speaker 1: And finally, step three is the old way is having no brand presence. Right? Just having a website and a buy button. But That causes a lack of trust. You have difficulty selling. You get treated as commodity. You get quoted against ten other agencies. So the new way like we're talking about throughout the call is leveraging media and content to bold trust and sell on autopilot without you having to speak to prospects directly. So we can leverage these video case studies, these assets, these sales assets, and we can also leverage your content. Because if prospects are seeing that you're posting content, your active view are providing value for free upfront, they're gonna be much more inclined to want to get on to a call. But also to buy from you. Right? Second, the old way is speaking to unqualified prospects. So you waste hours told me that people aren't even interested in getting onto a call or even having the conversation. So what we wanna do? Because your time is valuable. Because if you're a business owner, you have other things to do, is we wanna presell prospects before calls to pre warm them to increase a close percentage. So we really don't want you to explain in what you do on a call. Like, this should be this should be known before they even get onto the call. Right? That is really our goal. And thirdly, it's just having no sales process. So if you feel like you're constantly guessing what to say, you just hop on the call and ask some questions and, you know, hope for the best. This is what most agencies do, to be honest, it does not. Right? So what we want is a fully optimized sales process, and what we also do is if this could be beneficial for you, what we do is because we're working with generally eight figure agencies, what we do is we just provide the systems used by them in terms of their sales process. And just duplicate it for all of our other clients that don't have a sales process in place. So what you get is a fully optimized sales process from day one That's proven to work. That's proven to generate seven, eight figures. And what we also do is we consistently iterate on it to make sure you're getting as much feedback as possible and improving it while also having weekly evaluations. So either myself or someone on the team will hop on with you or your sales team to make sure they are closing as many deals as possible. By listening to their calls, giving feedback and everything to that degree. And what you get is finally, systematically converting interested prospects into high paying funds. So in summary, you can use our three step system to increase your revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within six to nine months. And nearing the end of this, you know, presentation is that you really have three options at this point. You can, I mean, continue what you're doing now? I'm not really having the predictable way to sign clients. Option two is working with a lead gen agency or a lead gen service software. I mean, that doesn't really care what happens with the outcomes and who most likely won't even deliver great qualified leads or anything to that degree. And option three, you could partner with us because we've done this so many times before, have the high level skills from five hundred k plus employee and generally have your best interest at heart. So remember Daniel also Lawrence King and Chris, all the other case studies and the ones that didn't even mention, they started their agencies to help people and make money. And they worked so hard to deliver an amazing service, make their clients happy, and put systems in place. But now, they had the service, but nobody to sell the service too. So booking meetings, the signing clients became the bottleneck. So they tried outreach themselves by work with Allegion service, but they still couldn't achieve the growth that they wanted. And the problem was that they didn't have a client acquisition system. Right? They had leads, but they didn't have the entire system starting with the offer, with the process. With the sales, you know, conversions. So we helped them to build out a brand new offer, build foundation marketing access, launch their campaigns, book meetings, pre sell, optimize the process and continually improve to be able to add an extra twenty, fifteen hundred thousand a month to the revenue. So now, They're removed from client acquisition. They have the time to do anything they want can focus on being a business owner and managing their teams, while the business generally signs clients on autopilot. So one of the last things is that some of the outcomes are working with us is that you'll be able to predictably book meetings to sign clients using proven scalable systems You can add an additional fifty to a hundred k a month to your agency within six to nine months. You can finally stop worrying. But when you sign your next client and bring in predictable cash flow, Don't forget about working with nightmare clients and have complete choice over who you want to work with, and you'll just feel calm and confident knowing that the acquisition side of your business will always be taken care of and ran by the numbers. So the last thing is a quick implementation plan on exactly how long things will take to get going. So phase one is prepare the vessel, and this typically takes two to three weeks and in most cases, ten to fourteen days. And this includes everything. In terms of getting set up, so collecting the case that is building new offer, optimizing your profiles and creating the outbound campaigns, Right? So this is all it takes to get sent out, to starting results, and beyond this, we launch. Right? So I've ten days, fourteen days, potentially, we launch the campaigns. And theoretically, if messes are going out, bookings can come in. And if bookings can come in, then clients can be signed and revenue can be generated. So this is launching and running the campaigns on email and LinkedIn. And the phase three, again, immediately after phase one, is just optimizing your sales process. So having the dedicated sales from convertible license bookings, adding the pre selling systems, optimizing a process and weekly evaluation with myself or the head of, you know, sales at our company. So I spoke for a long time. Hopefully, I didn't cut out because of the Internet. Do you have any questions?
Speaker 0: No. Not in the moment. I think I think you covered everything that I I kinda need to know at the moment. You know, there's kind of I suppose you could go into tactics all the way that you do stuff in respect of, you know, what emails, what messaging might look like? You know, who who you're approaching? Who the kind of, you know, the sales team are? How are they approaching them? Because obviously, you know, in a in a kind of smallish market like Australia, obviously, our reputation is -- Yeah. Paramount and important. So, you know, I I obviously wanna be sure that, you know, it's the right type of messaging that's going out and so forth. But But obviously, I'm I'm I'm open. You know, I'm open to your system. So, yeah, let's carry on.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent, and I wanna emphasize that everything we do is completely transparent. So if you do wanna see the messaging, if you do wanna adjust the messaging, if you do wanna adjust targeting, that can be done at any point. Right? It's
Speaker 0: I'd love to be across it. I'm I'm not somebody that needs to get in the way, but I'd I'd certainly wanna know what was going out. K.
Speaker 1: Cool. Yeah. Hundred percent. So this is pretty much the end of the presentation. Obviously, there's, you know, the other details, the good stuff. But before I go on to that, Is there anything that's unclear on the process? Any questions that you might have? I just wanna make sure everything's good before we move on.
Speaker 0: No. I'd I'd love to have this video meeting and and the presentation afterwards just to, you know, just just to have a look over or just to kind of think about what you said it. Yeah, at a later time and and just to show my partner as well. And so, yeah, that'd be good.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Not a problem at all. And the last thing I wanna touch on is on the actual messaging, the way we go about this, And I've seen I mean, I see hundreds of messages every day in terms of how people do outreach. And our approach is very, very different. And in the sense, just to give an example, it's because ours is extremely outcome focused. So what we like to do is leverage anything you've done at the as anything you've done in the past as our foundation of the actual outreach. So for example, if you work with a company, you help them to increase efficiency, you know, increase productivity by two hundred percent. This will be the foundation of our messaging. So it's not like we're gonna give them some weird free audit or twelve page PDF to get them onto a call. That's not the case at all. What we like to do is say, hey, we help this, let's say, e commerce brand to generate or increase productivity by five hundred percent then we reach out to, you know, a similar e commerce brand and say, hey, this brand is exactly like yours. We help it to increase productivity by five hundred percent. Would you be open to getting it on the call? We we can explain how we did that for them. Right? It's completely outcome based and it just What it does is because we're not giving away, like, weird PDFs or things to that degree, everyone that comes onto the call is guaranteed to be interested in the outcome and only the outcome. So you're not, you know, to call for people who just came with something free, They're coming on because they're genuinely interested in what you do. So it just adds a layer of qualification that will always be there when you speak to them.
Speaker 0: Yep. It's so important. And one thing that from kind of the lead gen agencies or the growth agencies or, you know, paid acquisition. You know, we we haven't really got those stats that, you know, they they live off of, you know. We do a lot of things that, like I told you, on the the first meeting companies that come to us with a problem you know, that they've been using a spreadsheet for five years and they've just outgrown it and, you know, there's a bottleneck and, you know, we need to make them more efficient. So it yeah. I mean, there's, you know, we could look into the time saved and stuff like that and try and get some kind of you know, formula there. But but, yeah, it's not as hard and fast as as those type of companies with the type of stats they use. But yeah.
Speaker 1: Think people
Speaker 0: are aware of that.
Speaker 1: That's perfect. I'm so glad you brought that up because I was thinking about this after our last call. And again, it's it's like the fact that you're working in Australia, people see it could see it as a disadvantage. But this again could be another advantage because most people in the development space, they think, yeah, we we don't have any stats. So we just say, hey, I'm a development guy. Five work with us. So what we can do is exactly like you said. If they increase their efficiency, it equates to time saved, And if we take the average, you know, pay for employee in this in the sector of the business, we just multiply that by the time saved. That's revenue side. Yeah. Sure. So, you know, exactly. Yeah. Because you guys are doing an incredibly useful or providing an incredibly useful service to these businesses. So yeah. I think we we'll have a great time with that in terms of -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: the outcomes.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. No. I do. And I think we just need to be a little bit creative in the way that we position ourselves and get across those those outcomes. To to, yeah, to interest, you know, the present you know, the potential kind of buyer. So yeah. That's so totally. And and I think also, I think it's just you you know, I've just I've just left it for a little bit to getting back into the the flow of things as an agency and getting back into it. And we're kind of humming along a little bit in the last couple of months, but you know, having that predictability and and just those those calls, I just feel that we could convert because I've I've got the case studies. I've got the team. I've got the experience. It's just getting in front of people. So so, yeah, if you could provide that Ethan, yeah, we'll we'll be good.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. And the last thing that I just wanna quickly touch on before going to the other, you know, other details is that we don't wanna look at this like we're just generating leads because everything that we do feeds into everything else that we do. So by collecting these video case studies or just one example, by collecting these case studies. It's gonna allow you to book more meetings, but it's also gonna allow you to increase your close percentage. Right? By building out the new offer. It's not just, you know, having new offers. It's also gonna allow you to stand out. It's also gonna allow you to put more meetings. It's also gonna allow you to, you know, close more clients. Have an easier time selling it. So everything just feeds into itself, and it's just gonna get exponentially easier as you go along. And as you get more case, there is more referrals, more, you know, inbound, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Extremely fast growth.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No, that's great.
Speaker 1: Right. Cool. So in terms of the details. Before I go to the pricing, I do wanna mention that we also guarantee results. So we guarantee that within sixty nine months, that you will reach our revenue target of helping you add an extra fifty to a hundred thousand per month. Right? And if not, myself, co founder, my partner, the head of sales, your account manager, all the all the reps in the sales team will work completely free until you hit this outcome. So what this outcome entails? Is that you who you will have generated an extra fifty thousand in monthly revenue, and this will obviously be worked out depending on your project size, things to that degree. But either way, you are guaranteed not just to make an ROI, not just to make your money back, but you're guaranteed to make a huge return on your investment because we definitely don't charge, you know, fifty thousand per month. So In terms of the pricing, the way we structure things is what I have on the left is if you were to get every single component of the service individually, from a consultant, a separate vendor, another agency, things of that degree, and then the price that you pay for this service. So obviously, foundational offer creation, niche research, messaging, you know, three k one time, case study videos edited, distributed, repackaged, you know, and sales assets the same with that every single month, two thousand one hundred per month. And outbound LinkedIn team created and managed two, three, for nine months, an outbound email team created managed trained three thousand eight hundred, end to end sales process creation, optimization, three, nine plus two k, software, SOPs, prebuilt templates, hiring everything to that degree, three, six, four, nine or, yeah, three, six, four, nine months. But Obviously, we don't charge that much. The way we structure things is we have two pricing options. Option one is seven thousand eight hundred per month for nine months. And option two is four thousand nine hundred plus nine percent of revenue growth for nine months or per month for nine months and the way that the nine percent works is, you know, in your case because you're offering, you know, software packages, this number can be adjusted actually. But the way we structure things for other clients is that it's four thousand nine hundred per month pertainer, plus a percentage of the first month that they generate with a new client.
Speaker 0: That's the first month that sorry. Just just repeat that again.
Speaker 1: Sure. So with clients that offer a retainer, you know, so they get paid every single month. What we do is we take nine percent off of the first month's retainer. So in cases where there is development or bigger one time fees, what we like to do is take your typical fee So for example, forty to hundred and fifty thousand divided over twelve months so that we get, you know, certain month to month, and then take nine percent off of the first month. I know it might seem a bit complex there. It's easier if it's written down.
Speaker 0: Sure. Okay. Alright. So, yeah, let let me I mean, I've I've got questions, but I'm I'm just launches the time now as well because I've got to get get going, but Yeah. Let me let me have a think about it, Ethan.
Speaker 1: Yep. No problem. No problem. While I'm here, can I answer any of the questions?
Speaker 0: Yeah. I mean so, you know, you you you're kinda guaranteeing that that fifty to a hundred thousand after six or nine months, but you kind of got like a five grand a month up until, you know, say, six months. So you know, we're looking at at, you know, a fair amount there upfront before we generate some income. So yeah. I I just yeah. It's it's a little bit on the high side for me at the moment. I'm looking at it. To be honest. So, yeah, just wanna wanna kinda look over those figures and and just see how that can can kinda work because Yeah. Really need to. I I thought you might have had a performance option rather than such a big big monthly retainer. Are we talking Australian dollars there?
Speaker 1: U. S. Dollars.
Speaker 0: U. S. Dollars. Yes. So exchange rates are killer for me at the moment. It's it's huge. So, you know, we're looking at five grand. Can you just put that in? What what what Well, put put in the seven thousand eight hundred. So we're probably looking at, like, thirteen to fourteen grand a month. Yeah. I I'm not gonna be able to afford that, to be honest with me. That that's too high, way too high. So yeah. Let me I'm a bit shocked actually to be honest how high it is. In in US dollars as well. Yeah. So let me let me mull over the if you could send me the video and also your your presentation. Let me let me just have a look at that. I've I've got my kind of partner in in the business is is also my partner. So just want to run it by her and and have a look at some stuff and and have a think. But are they the only options available?
Speaker 1: They are at this point.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Alright. So alright. Leave that with me. Let me I've got a run out now. So so let me get back to you over the next couple of days. I won't sit on it too long. Let me just mull it over. Send me those those details, and I'll get I'll get back to you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's not a problem at all. Appreciate your time regardless. And now hope you have a great day. I'll send everything as soon as the video uploads and then Yeah.
Speaker 0: Sure. Sure. No worries. No. I appreciate your time and thanks for running through that. It is very, very interesting. And I'll just have a look and get back to you in the next next few days to say by the end of the week.
Speaker 1: Sure. Not a problem at all. Alright, Paul. Prudent. Time, and I'll talk to you soon.
