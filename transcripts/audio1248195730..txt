Speaker 0:  Hello?
Speaker 1: Hello, Eden. How are you?
Speaker 0: Doing very good. How are you?
Speaker 1: Nice to nice to finally be in touch with you.
Speaker 0: Likewise. Likewise. We spoke a long time ago. Glad to go vote.
Speaker 1: Yes. In February, I think, we started the conversation, but we were caught into some projects.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So
Speaker 1: What are you what are you based?
Speaker 0: I'm in Cape Town right now, not for long, though. Where are you based?
Speaker 1: Republic of Moldova, Eastern Europe.
Speaker 0: Republic of Moldova. Sounds nice.
Speaker 1: Correct? Yes. Indeed. Great.
Speaker 0: Otherwise, as a weekday?
Speaker 1: Always good. Always good.
Speaker 0: That's great. Yeah. Alright. Cool.
Speaker 1: Before we jump in to describing our model of business and what we have been working on all along. Could you please give us a small introduction how you actually help agencies grow?
Speaker 0: Absolutely. And I just wanna make sure before we speak in, Irina, is that that correct?
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes. Yes. That's that's that's right, Irina.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. Yeah. So Irina, to give a very quick overview of what we do, is we help establish marketing agencies to increase their revenue by fifty to one hundred k per month within around sixty nine months And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right? So usually, these agencies, they have all the foundations that they need already to scale. So they have the systems, they may have the team members, they may have posh results, they may have the ability to solve, They just are not speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day. And, you know, obviously, if we can get you in contact, with people that want what you're offering, that need what you're offering, and that you can help, and you can speak to them every single day, then scaling up and increasing revenue is pretty much inevitable. And the way these calls usually go is I really just wanna start off by asking you some quick questions help me understand where you are, where you wanna be, and if we could potentially help you get there. And then, obviously, if you see my good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works in a lot more detail. And then we can go from there. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. Yeah. So we're at team of four. And Currently, we have been working as an outsourced firm for a somebody based company. So we have been providing from content development to the website development creative and so on. In the means of financial, our biggest projects along the way were the annual reports across the relations field, which take place, like, for five to six months of implementation. So that's that. Few other projects were on the brand identity. So mostly we are focusing on creative and content creation for the business field. As well on the on lead acquisition. So we had an attempt last year same with the agency, and that didn't perform well. Mhmm. But considering the the the do circumstances right now, that the market is down. How quick we can get respondents into a contact so we can acquire a few links?
Speaker 0: How quickly would we be able to get you in contact with new leads?
Speaker 1: Yes. Like, how how many weeks we are speaking of?
Speaker 0: That's a great question. So obviously, I mean, understand a bit more about who you're actually looking to get in contact with before I can actually give a time frame. But typically, how long it usually takes to get set up is within ten, fourteen days. That we can get things going and get you in contact with them. So just to recap what you said, you're a team of four right now. Yes. It's been working as an outsourced firm. Your main projects are in content, content creation, creative.
Speaker 1: I could if you allow me, I could share the screen and I could just show you a few examples.
Speaker 0: Sure. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So from from presentations, to landing pages, to websites, to the annual reports, I will start with the reports. These are the our flash cut. Just one second, please.
Speaker 0: Sure.
Speaker 1: But this is mainly for the for the IR field.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: And then reports are starting from from September. So here we are speaking of project implementation so far. Yes. The project requires the questionnaires with the companies
Speaker 0: -- Mhmm. --
Speaker 1: with listed companies getting and research the data. Receiving the internal files
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Mhmm. -- are two diligence, then creating the content to meeting. Usually, if it's a country for example, with with the national identity language. In this case, it's Arabic. And English, it has to be provided in both. So we develop the content we received the data, the financial data, and so on. And we incorporated it.
Speaker 0: It's very nice.
Speaker 1: Okay. The next one. So this one was for the a chain of petrol stations.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: This one is another listed company. So with the area, it's in the IT and servicing sector. Mhmm. So another reporting incorporates all from macro overview to the business model to the risk, to the strategy, to the ESG part and financial and government statement. So this is what we have done it recently. This is another one. This one is an Arabic. So what we are left now is that we finalize the projects. And we need badly new leads and don't sustain for another round. That's why it's my assistant understanding how long does it take?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Completely understand. And that's great, by the way. So obviously, you need more leads. So what's the goal with the business overall just so we can get an actual number on it?
Speaker 1: At least if we get two leads for example, if I don't know five k a month or so as a plan, so we can sustain it.
Speaker 0: So just two leads at five k month. That's a goal.
Speaker 1: But depending on the on the scope and the goal, and and which market we should tap into it, because currently we have been working more in Saudi Arabia, who would be grateful if we can enter a new markets. For example, US along them and so on.
Speaker 0: Yeah. We can definitely talk about that. So in an ideal world, who would your ideal customer be? Who would you want to work with?
Speaker 1: Big firms or to be as an an outsourced company for the advisory firms. As we have been already in contact when we we are experiencing. Cool. So Either it's it's it's an adviser of firms who need assistance with the content creation and creative. Or it's direct to the companies who need assistance with the white materials with the content, with presentations and some rebranding.
Speaker 0: Okay. That's great.
Speaker 1: So far in our portfolio, we have more than ten clients, big ones.
Speaker 0: You have more than ten clients right now? Yeah. That's perfect. That's perfect. Alright. So ideally, you know, you mentioned big firms. Is there any specific industry that you like to target?
Speaker 1: Not not not not quite specifically. It can be any any any companies like chains, I don't know in any companies. As I just mentioned to you previously, so where we have been in contact with acquiring leads, professional. So he had been targeting a low base profile of clients. Catering cleaning companies and services and so on. And at that time, it resulted to zero.
Speaker 0: Zero.
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes. And the campaign was rolling on for, like, one month or so. Wow. Yeah. And the channels were, like, LinkedIn base. Yeah. Yeah. That was the main tapping point.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Why do you think it should work?
Speaker 1: Sorry?
Speaker 0: Why do you think it didn't work?
Speaker 1: I don't know, to be honest. Maybe it wasn't the right time or maybe it was the the offer that didn't quite represent a lot. Because first, we start as a SEO company that provides changing optimization. And websites, and it didn't go well. Like, it wasn't a specific offer. About everything and nothing. Yes.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're completely right. If it's the broad office never tend to go well. Alright. Cool. And, obviously, what we wanna do and the way we typically do things is we leverage your past results to help you get more of the same client. So if you hope to firm making ten million or a hundred million in this industry, what we'll do is we'll just go after similar companies or even bigger ones and say, hey, we help this company to get these results, would you be open to give them the same? That's pretty much our framework behind doing this. It's very outcome based. It's very specific. So in terms of the results that you get for your clients, are there any sort of numbers or metrics that you track for them? Any sort of, you know, revenue numbers that you help to generate?
Speaker 1: That's a very good question. So what we offer, it's a case study of performance during the year. So this is an intangible asset for the listed companies but actually that provides value in time with them attracting attention for the investors. Yeah. So that's the in base. Quite metrics for those companies. How many how many investors that they got in touch with? We cannot compare because we we don't retain such information. Usually, this is this product is required by the CMA regulations and sec regulations like in America. That you need to post the financial performance in the listed listed profile. No. No. It's like NASDAQ and so on. But in America, we observed that there is not much go into detail of the design as per in Europe and the Middle East and to China and so on. This product, it it has a period of time, which starts from September, and it ends in the end of March. Mhmm. Submission.
Speaker 0: I see. I see. Alright. So are there any numbers at all that you guys track in terms of the results?
Speaker 1: As an outsourced company, we have been in agreement of how much we are gonna receive as a revenue. From the and would would count the scope, the cost, and the time, and as a total. But this is our side not not the not the client side.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Unfortunately, in that situation, I don't think we'll be able to help you out.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 0: Again, I really appreciate your time. That's great speaking to you. But just because of the fact that we won't be able to leverage significant metrics in terms of what you did for the companies in the past. And, you know, assuming that this is our main method for actually attracting the clients, I just don't think our method of doing it will be the most effective for you. So the last thing I want is for you to, you know, wouldn't want you to get bad results like the last agency. You know?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. Absolutely. Usually, you take clients based on what on on metrics? Like, do they provide you kind of metrics on their revenues?
Speaker 0: Yeah. There's a I'll tell you the few things that I look for or that the team looks for when we're taking on new clients. The first one is past results. Right? So who have you helped in the past? And what result did you get for the clients? So for example, most of our clients now, they're offering very outcome based services. So for example, SEO, pay per click, conversion rate optimization, TikTok ads, whatever it might be. And it's very clear what the outcome was. So for example, generate an extra two hundred thousand in sales. This is the first thing that we look for, a tangible outcome. The second thing that we look for is just being established, so having the team, having the systems having understanding of business in general. We tend to never work with beginners. And then thirdly, what we look for is either a brand or business presence. So having some sort of established brand, whether that's the founder, the owner, you know, having a, you know, posting content or the business having great website, assets, things to that grid.
Speaker 1: Okay. What we have those the website and so on, but I already got your points. So thank you very much.
Speaker 0: Thank you too. I wish I wish we could have helped you. But unfortunately, next time
Speaker 1: next time. We start small. So hopefully next time, we'll come back to New Dutch.
Speaker 0: Please -- Thank you. -- any questions, miss Schmidt. Anytime, I'm happy to help.
Speaker 1: Absolutely. Thank you, Ethan.
