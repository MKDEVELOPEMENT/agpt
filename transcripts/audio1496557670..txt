Speaker 0:  Please see if you look at the analysis. Hey, Ethan.
Speaker 1: Paul. How are you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Good. Thanks, mate. How are you?
Speaker 1: I'm doing excellent, man. Glad to get this call scheduled.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. No. Thanks for taking taking it. And Yeah. No. Good to meet you. I mean, obviously, you've been seeing your content on LinkedIn, YouTube all around the place. Like in what you're saying, and just wondering kind of a little bit more about what you do and how you do it, really?
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. That's great. Yeah. So if you open to it, I can get a start with everything if you'd like.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. So, I mean, these goals are pretty straightforward. I just wanna start off by asking some quick questions. Help me understand where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially help you get there, obviously, if you seem like we should not walk you through the entire offer, how it works, and all the next steps beyond that. And then we can go from there. Is that okay with you, Paul?
Speaker 0: That's yeah. Absolutely fine. Go ahead.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Alright. Cool. So best place to start. What was the main motivation for? Wanted to take the call in the first place.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So I have I've never done cold email or cold cold outreach at all, really. The business we're a software agency, and we a few years back, we were, you know, just referrals little bit of Google ads. Things things were kind of, you know, ticking along really nicely. And then went off and started to build product and kind of let things slip. Mhmm. And it's only in the last year or so that I've I've just started to get back into the swing of things of getting the agency back up and firing again. So we still make products, but I just want to obviously focus on the agency. We've always had quite a good reputation in Sydney where Australia is most of our clients. And, yeah, it was just a case of looking at different you know, I've just see you know, I'll be completely honest with you. I've I've just seen in the last kind of six months say Twitter, LinkedIn, just, you know, people like yourself and I I love your content. I'm not dumping you in with everybody else. But, you know, just just the results, you know, the the fact that, you know, there's a lot of great tools out there, the fact that you you're reaching the people that you you you wanna reach rather than, you know, the wrong target audience. And then, unfortunately, at the moment, I'm kinda hitting a lot of people which is good in a way. It it's good in some ways and and, you know, in other ways, I could do more of a mix of of clients. So I'm getting quite a few few startups, whereas before I used to have quite a few businesses.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And, you know, I'm still getting the business leads and and we've still got a few quite a few, you know, business clients. But I I'm wanting to see more of the kind of clients that I'm just not seeing in my leads. And I was hoping that kind of cold calling could could get us there to at least get the the door open and have a conversation.
Speaker 1: That's perfect. That's perfect. So just to recap the last part, you know, one of the major goals is signing more clients, obviously, but more importantly getting in contact with the right people, the people that you actually wanna work with.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Sure. Exactly.
Speaker 1: Alright? That's perfect. And we'll go into detail about who these businesses are. But the next question I just have is, obviously, the goal is to scale up to sign more clients do you have a a number of clients that you're looking to hit?
Speaker 0: A a number that we're looking to hit of clients. Not really. No.
Speaker 1: We haven't really talked about it.
Speaker 0: As revenue per month? It's a good question. No, not necessarily slowly. I mean, I I will have to think about that because, you know, I'd like to to obviously measure that and and I'd obviously like to have Foxteli realistic, but quite ambitious goal. So so yeah. I mean, just getting into revenue and how how our business works. I mean, we we go from anywhere to for a client in the first phase of getting the project off the ground anywhere from, say, forty thousand Australian dollars through to hundred and thirty, hundred and fifty thousand Australian dollars.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And that's, you know, that that's getting somebody on board and building the the first product, which take us three to four months. And then, you know, with the nature of our business, those clients end up being fairly sticky. Because, you know, it's quite a long process. You know, there's quite a lot of expertise that's gone into building mobile apps or custom software. And, you know, we we've got a fairly good reputation in respect of, you know, clients hang around and stay with us for quite a while. So So there's that aspect. But getting back to startups, what what what kind of happens with them is if if it doesn't kinda pick off for if they don't get funding, they kinda disappear a little bit. So you kinda put in that hard work real hard yards up front, you know, for three to six months. They haven't really got the money to to go to the next let you know, the next stage. They haven't got the money to to improve the application or you know, in marketing. So it kind of fizzles out, whereas a a business that's got something that that is built for either their customers or employees. There's, you know, obviously, a a need for for them to maintain that. There's improvements normally. And normally, if you're doing a good job, there's other projects within the company that come up. So that that that's my line of thinking at the moment in the type of targets we want. And so I suppose to make it really simple, you know, if we could get two leads, two leads that convert a month, I'd I'd be happy with that.
Speaker 1: Do leads a month.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's perfect. Yes. You got
Speaker 0: a big smile on your face. Is is that easy?
Speaker 1: Everyone tells me I should stop saying that it's gonna be easy on these calls, but I genuinely Yeah. No. No. It's not easy. We're working with another software development company now, FlexLabs. And they're charging very similar amount, you know, between a hundred and hundred and ninety thousand for their projects.
Speaker 0: Yep.
Speaker 1: And, I mean, we're we're finding it very straightforward. But again -- Okay.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: I can go into more detail on this.
Speaker 0: Where where are they based where are they based, Steve?
Speaker 1: Oh, so Flex is based in Oh, I know the the cofound he's based in UK. That's the first one.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And
Speaker 1: they have team members all over
Speaker 0: Yeah. Because of their client base. I mean, where where are you getting these kind of where are you getting these leads from? Is it like main one territory?
Speaker 1: Oh, no. No. No. No. Well, him or for that company, it's international. They have no real no real limit on who they can work with in terms of
Speaker 0: -- Okay. --
Speaker 1: potential. Yeah. Great.
Speaker 0: And and neither of we, I mean, I've, you know, just so you know, a bit of grounding us. I've got team members here and and in Poland in in Europe. And and I'm also you know, I'm originally from London, so I've got kind of quite quite kind of close ties to to the UK. So, yeah, I think, you know, we we we wouldn't limit ourselves to Australian based companies. And I'm also, you know, there's we've got the capacity and we're ready to grow. So if that two is what I'm saying is if we convert those that would be great. That number, but if we did four, six, I I you know, it would be fantastic.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So you have the capacity and you're ready to grow. And ideally, we need to get you in contact with more businesses as opposed to start ups because the start ups are It's a bit more unpredictable. There's chance they'll fizzle out if they don't get the funding things to that degree. But businesses, they're more stable. My deal that might have any projects in the future, would that be correct?
Speaker 0: That that would be correct. Yes. One one thing with I'd I'd go back with startups sometimes they're quicker to make decisions. Obviously, there's less people there. They haven't got a board to answer to. There's not, you know, different departments. They can usually make a decision. So So, you know, I I think it depends where our offer is and where you're kind of going with this if if you think that it's possible to to hit those two markets or you wanna niche down into one particular buyer persona as such. I'd I'd I'd be led by you and see and see how you wanna go.
Speaker 1: That's perfect. And the way we usually do it just to give some context is we base who we target off of who we have helped in the past. So do you have studies or past results in any of the yes?
Speaker 0: Definitely. So Yeah. There's, you know, there's a global manufacturer that we build a sales application for. There's a rate sky that we've we've just built recently, there's on the startup side, there's like a memory baby book that's just gone out and and getting getting good good response. We also handle the the biggest camping app in Australia. Well, we'll be after this next build. We we built one app for them that's still out there and we just completely rebuilt it with community and -- Mhmm. -- they've also got a whole heap of different things going with it. So so that's that's a really big application on the kind of consumer side. And then on the business side, yeah, there's a lot of different businesses that we've worked with. But as I say, I'm kind of picking up where we were four or five years ago. We we kind of went down that product route that that did okay, and it's still kind of, you know, bubbling along. But now the agency, I've got a great team we've got capacity and I'm ready to grow. And I think when I'm in front of people, I I can convert them. It's really just down to, you know, well, there's normally a number of factors, but -- Mhmm. -- you know, you've got to convince people that that, you know, you've got team. And you've also got the, you know, the yeah. If I'm dealing with somebody in the UK, they're gonna wanna talk somebody on the u in the UK on on those on that time time zone. So but there's no not a problem for us to hire people, you know. That that's not
Speaker 1: a problem. These are all the things I love to hear on these calls. All the things I love.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No. Totally. No. We're we're we're ambitious. And you know, we we know that we can do the job and deliver it's really getting those leads and and that's what I've I've kind of it's really funny because the way the business I suppose it's got got more competitive like like most businesses over time. But four or five years ago, because we were, you know, really into, you know, the agency and the agency was flying along, we were getting lots of good leads coming into us organically and referrals. And that kind of dried up when we stopped, basically. So, you know, it's a case of reigniting that again and getting that off the ground, and that's what we're prepared to do.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. So you have the capacity. You're ready to scale up. You have case studies and a ton of great ones as well. You have the team and you understand how to hire for the roles, and you can convert slash, you can sell it. We can just get you on con like, in contact with these audio prospects. Yep. You have everything. So the goal would be to sign two clients a month at around forty to a hundred thirty thousand. And the only thing stopping is just speaking to enough qualified prospects every day?
Speaker 0: Yes. Exactly.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Alright. Cool. And then I just wanna get some context on the actual pricing. So I know you mentioned the first space is around forty thousand to a hundred and thirty thousand. Do you charge that upfront? Do you split it out over months? Is it a retainer?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Spill it. Spill it out over months. So so yeah, I mean, is probably ten percent to fifteen percent taken as a a commencement fee. Mhmm. And and then it split over split over milestones really, project milestones. Oh, so that that sounds good.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's perfect. Alright. Cool. And then another thing I wanted to ask is because it clearly sounds like you have an amazing business here already. How are you currently attracting clients right now?
Speaker 0: Yeah. So at the moment, I'm not doing any I'm not doing any Google ads. The website is not converting. I I I need to step that up. So I'm using I'm using a a service that that basically don't know whether you're aware of it, bark at all. No. No. They're a UK company. UK company. And you know, they're they're basically, you know, they'll come up with first and and, you know, you put out developers, they'll be up there, you know, paid ads
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And the way they work is they they charge a, you know, I think it's probably thirty to forty dollars a lead. Mhmm. But those leads are quite I've had some good leads and some really interesting projects, but you've really got to get through them. I mean, the conversion rate is quite small and it really is not down to, you know, me being shit at sales or, you know, the team or anything like that. It it really like people that oh, I thought an app cost five thousand dollars or, you know, they're really kind of quite unqualified leads.
Speaker 1: And
Speaker 0: that's what I found really frustrating because I'm used to dealing with people that one know what they wanna do in respect of, you know, they'll come to us for recommendation but they're very serious about what they're looking to do. Whereas the a lot of these leads are people that have, you know, got an idea that's come to them on a Friday night. They put something out at the weekend, then they think it's gonna cost ten grand to build an application that looks like Instagram.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: So it's you know, it's very different. But saying that, there is some interesting, really interesting projects that come through that. So It's something that I'm I'm just kind of living with and referrals as well. Referrals we we still get, you know. Cool. So so that's always a good thing.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I mean, that's just another indicator that you're graded what you guys do if you're growing from the referrals. Which is another Yeah. I'm sorry.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We that's just been steady. So so I just wanted something a bit bit more predictable in respect that you know, predictable in in the quality of the leads. That's what I mean more more than, you know, not after quantity.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: I I'd I'd really kind of want and I know it's a hard game in what you guys do in respect that it's cold outreach and stuff. But if, you know, if if it does come down to, you know, having conversations with people that are serious about, you know, building something, then then we we can certainly be in the mix. You know, most of these people would probably have two or three quotes. But but I find that I do most of the selling. I find that, you know, I can build a rapport. I've been very experienced in in that field that I've worked in. And I feel that, you know, we we can normally win it. It's just a case that we we with the bigger clients, we might lose out to somebody that's you know, they've got the bigger higher ticket kind of, you know, brand logos, you know, whereas, you know, we've we've got some big ones off now, but Again, that was work that we did four or five years ago. It's hard for me it's hard for me to pull on a couple of those, whereas, yeah, you've obviously got some some of our competitors are, you know, dealing with the the top guys. Mhmm.
Speaker 1: A hundred percent of the quality is actually a very important factor as opposed to just, you know, calls off the calls off the calls because, I guess, with the bark, you might be paying thirty dollars to forty dollars per lead. That's not a lot, but it's also the time that you spend on these calls.
Speaker 0: Yes.
Speaker 1: If you only cause yourself, you probably have a lot of other things to do and by wasting it to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: I do. I mean, I think, you know, there's yeah. It it's really the follow ups. Yeah. You know, it's getting to qualify. I'm qualifying people a lot earlier, so I'm I'm kind of discounting a a lot of leads as early as possible. You know? I I don't mind frightening people with price because that is our price. We we're not gonna be changing that, you know. So, you know, and but then also there's the thing that we don't really software is something that it's not so easy to be able to go. Yep. That's gonna cost you forty grand. It's like, you know, there's a lot of scoping and understanding what people want and people don't always necessarily know what they want and saying something to me over the phone or or, you know, to discovery calls. It's very different to mapping it out on a whiteboard and understanding what kind of, you know, from a technical point of view is required. So, yeah, it's it's something that is interesting in that respect, but also kind of, you know, it's not It's not a hard and easy commodity that you just go, okay, we'll wear fifty k, guide down the road, sixty k, you know, it's there's a lot more into it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's a lot more complexity.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Totally. And getting getting and that and that's all about the discovery. And and that also gives you another you know, me and our team because I I have had these calls with my CTO as well in getting to understand whether we're a good fit, you know, whether, you know, they're a good fit for us and and we're a good fit for them and and that seeing what the the the relationship is. So I I don't mind having those those kind of calls when they're serious calls, you know. Yeah. We'll we'll spend our time having a narrow workshop. For for a job that could be worth, you know, lifetime value of, you know, two hundred thousand, you know, that that's more than worth our while to do that.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Like, you're willing to invest the time if you know that they're actually serious and they're actually qualified because then it's an amazing. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Besides services like Bak and obviously grown from referrals, Have you tried anything else to acquire clients?
Speaker 0: No. Nothing else at at the moment. You know, it's a long time ago. I said, it was it was kind of Google AdWords. There was some content marketing. There was kind of, you know, email magnets on their website. Sorry. You know? All types of, you know, email marketing in that respect, which was all kinda quiet, done at, you know, not not in a serious way. So so this is you know, I had to chat with somebody around kind of, you know, LinkedIn marketing in respect of, you know, hunting for for clients on that. And and kind of ghost writing. I didn't take up that offer. I I wanted to to write for myself, which I've started to to do over the last kind of three or four months. So, yeah, it's something that's cold yeah. I was looking yeah. And I was also looking at doing it myself, but I I kind of felt that I needed that push of somebody that knew what they were doing.
Speaker 1: That's such a smart choice. Right? I can't tell you how many times I hear that same thing. You know, they wanna try it themselves. And then they do and they waste like four years and they still don't figure it out. So the fact that you even say that just indicates a level of self awareness that most people don't need, which is Yeah. Because on that point, specifically about the quality of the quantity and the needing of predictability. It's the exact same situation as Flex, the other development company, I was talking about earlier, another one of our clients. And for them, generally, they only need one deal potentially every month. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yep. The thing for us is to get them in contact with, for example, seven, eight, nine figure e commerce brands. And, you know, if we can just do that predictably, you know, closing is pretty much inevitable. Something we could just use extremely similar approach for you as well, you know, only getting conquered in contact with seven figure eight figure nine figure brands. And businesses as opposed to start ups if that's what your ideal prospect is, and we can go after anyone.
Speaker 0: Yep.
Speaker 1: But it shouldn't be very complex in terms of delivery.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Okay. That that that that all sounds great.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool. So
Speaker 0: I think in I mean, the one one thing that you it has just got me thinking about flags is is that they've gone they've they've niche down in this specific that it's e commerce brands that they've gone forward, which is great because, you know, that that's what they're known for and and makes everybody's you know, the messaging, everything easier whereas we are quite diverse in in the client base that we've got. Custom software lends that self to it because, you know, everybody could have custom software. You know, it's it's something that you know, and and the way that and just to give you an idea of that kind of type of business customers that will come to us is they'll have internal processes that have just got you know, they'll be using spreadsheets for, although cobbled together two or three off the shelf and applications. That have worked up to a point, but then suddenly, you know, it it gets all clunky and, you know, they can't query the database like they need to. They can't do things that require, you know, proper kind of, you know, in the field applications or at least other things. And and that's the kind of, you know, problem that we solve is is kind of putting those things together. So and and we've got quite a varied mix of of kind of clients that we've worked for in that in that line of work. And and you don't steer a lot of it on our side and you don't you see that in the app or people say, well, what what actually got? Because there are business apps that are used primarily for internal reasons, you know, mainly for employees. You know, more so than leaving customers. You know, it's fixing a problem that, you know, the employees have got with that, you know, So, yeah, that that's the type of things that we get asked, you know, how group business is to to work on. Mhmm. And we love that stuff because we can really get our teeth into it and really improve I see an improvement kind of pretty soon -- Mhmm. -- with that with that type of solution.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. I I always end up noting out about things like this, like processes and spreadsheets and stuff. So this is perfect to me. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Good.
Speaker 1: So just so I know I heard it correctly, the main outcomes that you provide is helping the businesses with inefficient processes, they're using thousands of spreadsheets or, you know, stuck together with duct tape, and you're helping to really streamline this systemize it, put into, you know, a nice app that the employees can use, increase efficiency, things of that degree.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. That that's the type of thing that we we do and we do do very well. And yeah. And and when you think about it, every business gets to that point at some stage, especially if they're growing. And and, you know, that that's and, you know, they've had these things together for years that have worked and then suddenly they don't when they go from ten people to fifty people to fifty to a hundred, you know. So so that's where we come on board.
Speaker 1: Under the same. Oh, that's perfect. Okay. Cool. So just to recap everything, it seems like you genuinely have all the foundations ready. You have the capacity. You have amazing case studies. You have a great team. You can clearly solve at least, you know, even just based on this co identity you can solve. The goal is to get, you know, two clients per month, charging at least forty to a hundred and thirty thousand for the project. And the only thing stopping you from signing these clients is just speaking to enough qualified prospects on a daily basis that can afford what you're offering. That know what you offer, that understand software doesn't cost five k to look like Instagram. You know, if you can just get in contact with these prospects every single day, and scale will be pretty much inevitable. Does that sound reasonably close to the situation?
Speaker 0: So that that that would be close some would be a a situation that I'd be very happy to achieve. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Okay. Cool. I mean, based on that, you're like ninety nine percent of our past clients. We've seen great results. Do you mind for sure what the next steps would be?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Please do. Yeah. Yeah. Really interested. I mean, I was I was kinda not not concerned because I I I saw that you did agency stuff, but I I was thinking, you know, is it kind of smaller offers with marketing agencies that are you know, a five grand a month retainer or a ten grand a month retainer, which which is great. But but we're a very different type of solution.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Oh, a hundred percent. Hundred percent, especially in the sales process. But, like, we've got tons of experience in, you know, these sort of projects as well. It's not necessarily a 2K retainer over twelve months. That's much bigger projects, much longer potentially sales process, sales cycle. So perfectly fine. Yeah. So to give a quick overview of what we do is that we help establish marketing agencies to on average increase revenue by fifty to one hundred thousand a month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we're helping to solve is client acquisition. Right? Across the board, across all industries, across all niches that all face such a similar problem, and it's just that they can't acquire clients predictably. Right? So they have all the foundations already. They have capacity. They have the team. They have great case studies. They can sell They're just not speaking to enough qualified and emphasis on qualified prospects every single day that can afford what they're offering that want, what offering and that need what they're offering every day. And if they can do that, they can solve that one problem, then scale is extremely straightforward. So based on that -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal on exactly how I think we can help you reach, you know, your goal of signing two clients, probably even a lot more every single month?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Sure.
Speaker 1: Alright. Perfect. Let me just pull up the calendar. Would tomorrow at this time work for you?
Speaker 0: Tomorrow, I'm on a call. Yeah. On a client call, which could go on for a little. It would certainly be an hour and a half. And then then I might have my son's basketball game afterwards depending on when the the court finishes. So I'm interested to have this though. Is that where where about you based?
Speaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now, but I understand the time zone difference. We could even do an hour earlier. Yeah. This is what
Speaker 0: I was thinking. The time zone is a difference. Yeah. Yes. So so this call will know. This call will probably be be between five PM and six PM for me and could go on for an hour and a half. We I'll just tell you briefly. It's it's that it's the camping app that I told you about that we've completely rebuilt, say, yes, seven months seven months to build and it and it's the last week of getting to the final version. So it's all everybody's a bit touchy because it's been so long and, you know, it's one of those where the meeting could could go on. Everybody's on board for the meeting. So, yeah, it could be one. But let me let me have a think.
Speaker 1: That's perfectly fine. Come back
Speaker 0: to you on that one. Well, actually, I don't want you you to fill up your your your schedule. So so when you say an hour earlier, we we started at eight seven seven PM. What's the time there now? What what is the the difference?
Speaker 1: I'm not sure what the difference is, but it doesn't really matter
Speaker 0: to me. No. So so yeah. No. What what what's your What's the time now? What what's your time?
Speaker 1: It's eleven thirty AM time. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Eleven thirty AM. Okay.
Speaker 1: So if our earlier upload doesn't work, then we can set up another time for next week. It's not a problem at all. Then I'll just send over a calendar link and we can go from there.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's do that because I think tomorrow, I my head will be spinning as well after this year. Yeah. Yeah. Can you Has it? That'll be fine.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool. I'll send the link on LinkedIn straight after this call. But, Paul, it was honestly a pleasure speaking. Great learning about your business team.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Very likewise.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So in terms of the proposal between now and then, either myself or someone on the team will reach out just to confirm everything, check everything's good. And then on that call, what I'll start by doing is going through a ton of case studies of agencies very similar to yours. Our exact process that you could genuinely do this with or without us and then all the additional details like pricing, how to get started, things to that degree. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. That will sounds great. Yep. That's perfect.
Speaker 1: Fantastic. Cool. So I'll send you everything on LinkedIn and via email, and I'll talk to you then.
Speaker 0: Appreciate it. Have a good day. Thanks very much.
