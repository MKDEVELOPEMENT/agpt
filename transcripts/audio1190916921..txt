Speaker 0:  Adriana,
Speaker 1: a as in
Speaker 0: I will speak. Likewise. Likewise. How are you doing?
Speaker 1: Oh, well. Thank you. Just, you know, agency life. I think you know that.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. That's good. That's good. I wanted to make sure is the correct pronunciation, Adriana or Adriana?
Speaker 1: It's Adriana. Yeah. I'm I'm Italian origins, but then I've I've left Italy when I was young. So I I've lived in in different places, different continents, different culture, but yeah. So the exact pronunciation is atriano. Yes.
Speaker 0: Perfect. That's amazing. Our business partners from Italy as well, Milan.
Speaker 1: Italy. Okay.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool.
Speaker 1: Good.
Speaker 0: Say good.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. No. I was saying so thanks for thanks for having this call. So I have, of course, two questions, but I guess Do you want me to start kind of describing literally, you know, two minutes, what we are, what we do, and what we're looking for? Would that would that make sense? Or it's as as you prefer. So
Speaker 0: Absolutely. So I'll just give some context how the calls usually go. I just wanna start off by asking some quick questions. Up to that, you know, where you are where you wanna be. And if, obviously, we can help you get there. Obviously, if you seem like a good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, you know, how it works and we can go from there. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. That's perfect. Absolutely.
Speaker 0: Alright. Amazing. So, Adriana, what made you wanna take the call in the first place?
Speaker 1: We are so the the reason is we are relatively small agency. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: They just
Speaker 1: give an idea. So we we are about thirty people We have offices in the UK and in the US. And we primarily work in b to b space. So we are not a b to c agency, but we are in b to b. And we like to say that we are a growth agency in the demand space for B2B. We are relatively small thirty people, let's say, twenty ish in Europe, so UK, and then ten in the in the We are kind of at two point five million dollars three million dollars annual business. So let's say, two hundred, two hundred and k ish, two hundred and fifty k, sorry, a month of business. Our business and I come to the point to your point, but I guess this kind of small introduction is is important. So In terms of our business, Europe and U. S. Europe, let's say, sixty percent of the business and forty percent U. S. Very different segments that we target. In Europe, we target primarily enterprise customers in sectors like IT, technology, and we have some big names. Always like relatively small projects, but kind of, you know, big name in the tech because we were born. We tech, our first client. I was in there at the time, but our first client was HP. Mhmm. So we have still many clients in the tech business. Tech business, FinTech, particularly with we're finance, mid needs technology. So we have several clients there. And then also but I would say this is more by accident. We have some customers also in manufacturing, which is not necessarily a segments that we proactively target, but we have, you know, five or six lines in manufacture. That's Europe. US is completely different. US is primarily SMB business and SaaS company, software as a service, primarily on a on a kind of retainer base. So, I don't know, ten k customers that give us the the the keys of the marketing house And it's basically, you know, ten, fifteen, whatever, k per month. In Europe, it's we don't we don't work much on on retailers, so it's it's much more on kind of project phase kind of the traditional type of agency business. Why we're having this conversation? Because finally, I get your point to your question. We are small. We don't have sophisticated business development. We have nobody doing business development. I am in charge of the enterprise business in Europe. And then I have a a fellow who is in charge of the of the of the of the business in the US, and we all report to the and we both report to the managing director. No one is doing business development. Right? So the way we sign clients is I guess, you mentioned that in one of your videos. Right? The the way we send clients is primarily through personal networks, I've worked in the tech business for years in, you know, IBM and NSP and so on. So I know the tech business a little bit. Some kind of personal networks, referrals, but maybe maybe. We might have a a sales development rep from a partner agency that's gonna help us, you know, kind of doing the the outreach. But that's all. So we have nothing near, let's say, a systematic business development activity. So I guess that's a very long answer to your first questions, but I guess the next questions will be the the next answer will be much shorter actually.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent. And I really appreciate it. It gave so much useful context. He probably answered sixty percent of the questions that I usually have. So That's perfect. So just to recap everything and correct me if I'm wrong. You have around thirty people right now working for the agency, twenty in Europe, ten in US. News more towards enterprise IT, fintech. You've worked with big names in the past, so you have, you know, ton of establishment already. The U. S. Is more focused on SMB, SaaS, primarily on retainer basis, ten to fifteen k a month, mainly on project basis. Would that be correct?
Speaker 1: Hundred percent correct and probably an important point, I guess, for the for the for the turnaround for this conversation is that it might sound odd, but I would say that the the the US is not necessarily kind of keen to get tons of new business because they're saying, you know, we are ten here, ten ish. Let's say we are small. Our creative team is is here in the UK. Everything is here in the UK. We basically help them. So they don't have the bandwidth for the time being, for example, to take ten new clients. Of course, getting ten new clients, they will kind of get to the team will need to get, you know, to the next level in terms of skills, resources, and so on. So I'm not saying that they don't want new business. But they don't want, you know, volumes of new businesses because they they they believe and this is never end discussions, but they believe that they cannot handle. In on the contrary, in Europe, we are definitely looking for new business in a kind of more systematic way as I said.
Speaker 0: That's amazing. So the UK is I mean, the US isn't necessarily keen on getting huge influxes of new business, you know, constantly because they don't believe that they have the bandwidth. But on the other side, the EU, the Europe is able to take on more clients systematically?
Speaker 1: Yes. Definitely. And we can scale up and down because within the last three years, we were able to scale up, three large clients, scale up quickly clients, you know, then kind of sunset of some of the big clients, so scaled down. So we we are relatively agile to do that here in Europe.
Speaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. So Right now, the agencies at around two hundred and fifty thousand per month. What's your goal?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I think we can definitely at least double it in the next twelve months. I think that I believe that we have the skills and the offers. And then, of course, we can referring to your video. We have the author to get to that. It's just a question again on, you know, being noticed, getting noticed. And again, kind of, you know, we we tend to do I've been here now for eighteen months. Right? I came from a larger agency. And the the reason I joined is that these agencies of creation has brilliant ideas. Right? Bright people very focused on technology and innovation, you know, the use of technology now in in doing marketing, for example. But again, kind of we we we are small, sometimes, you know, more kind of freelancer type of things, you know, ten ideas per minute. But then, you know, you need to kind of operationalize all this and then, you know, run a cruise speed. Otherwise, you know, the ups and downs then are not are not good for the business. So
Speaker 0: Makes a lot of sense. So you guys definitely have a a great team behind you. Including your tech background already, which is amazing. So you wanna go from two hundred and fifty thousand per month to five hundred thousand per month. And the only thing stop you from getting there is just signing more of the clients that you wanna work with.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It it's it's signing more and really pitching pitching. I don't like to work pitch. Having business conversations with clients because in again, that that's why I say that that our offer is is relatively good because when we get the chance, when we have the chance to talk to to clients, we sign in the summer. Because because, again, you know, we have a client of a network. It's probably more in deep as well. We have a breadth really kind of a large portfolio of services. And we can work on small project, large projects, we can work on branding, so kind of more developing content or kind of taking existing content and make them usable, snackable, more digestible, I would say then to run, for example, demand gen or media campaigns. And then we have an account based marketing engine, you know, that allow us to say, okay, so very, very targeted kind of account based and individual based media campaigns that brings a return, let's say, higher than the average return on investment. And also, we have developed recently a kind of a a something we are pushing with our prospects a reward for good offering blockchain based that basically is, you know, attend the webinar or download this. White paper and then you can decide then how to use some credits offset your carbon footprint, you know, plant trees, remove plastic from the oceans, and then you get and if once you do that, you get NFVs. And so that's that's basically in a nutshell the offering that we have developed. And this is working relatively well, so here in both in Europe and in the US.
Speaker 0: Oh, man. That's amazing. So it really is the case that you just need more productive business conversations because you have an offer that's proven to convert. If you can just have the conversations, there's a very high likelihood that they'll sign up just because of the flexibility of your offer. That you can work with large projects, small ones, whatever they can benefit from. Right? Right.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And we have in the in the areas that I mentioned before. And I I if you had a look at on our website, by the way, we are kind of rebuilding it and it should be life any day soon. But we have some good case studies. In our case studies work on, you know, brands, so more kind of developing the overall value proposition and then creatives for a brand or for a solution or for a products or kind of the traditional agency exercise more in the awareness space. But we have, again, good good case that is also in account based marketing campaign that delivered higher return on investment for several clients. So That's why I say, we walk the talk. So we say, we believe that we have a very good ABM offering. Here it is. Right? This is what we did or two or three customers, saying we have a good creative team -- Mhmm. -- based here in the UK, because that's sometimes a concern with some European customers and say, oh, yeah. But, you know, so you create a team in the US so that they don't understand Europe and so on, so creative team is here. In Europe, we are born in Europe. So, yeah, it's it's just a question of, you know, getting the word out.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent. That's honestly fantastic. It generally sounds like you have everything that you need in order to convert and get noticed by these prospects. You have everything you need in order to do that. So that leads on to the next point on Who exactly do you want to work with? Obviously, you mentioned a a couple of different industries, but what would be the ideal one for you?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So in I I I speak for the enterprise business here in here in Europe. If I have to if I have to run a kind of a systematic business development, the activity or demand generations campaign, and I would primarily target three segments. The first one is startups. And with startups here, you you know, that you can get some some list from excuse me. You can get some list from data provider that gives you basically the list of well, these are the list of, you know, three hundred companies that raised funds from VCs and so on in the last I don't know, six months. Right? Mhmm. And they are somehow likely to to outsource, for example, whom marketing function or, you know, some specific demand gen or the branding and this kind of thing. So I think startups in Europe -- Mhmm. -- is segments. I know that it's relatively large. But when I say startup is basically startup in technology, let's say, and fintech, which is still large. But, you know, that's that's, I would say, the first segment. The other one is the IT security market. In Europe is globally. But if we just stay here in Europe, it's very large and growing. And we are not getting any fair share of that in terms of a marketing agency. Yes, we heard in the past a couple of IT security companies, global ones. And again, I think that there is a I would say significant opportunity to target those companies, especially, let's say, not not the kind of the global large ones you know, they they the the checkbox, the zscaler, or these kind of things. But probably, again, IT security company, and security is huge. IT's gonna security company born in Europe, and they're proud to be, you know, we are not large, you know, corporations. We are European companies. We know Europe with all kind of all the you know, the the the the peculiarities actually of Europe. And therefore, you know, we want to work with European partners in, you know, or brand or for demand generation. So IT security could be a second target. And then I guess that the third one is, I know probably it's not the best moment to do that. But I would say the the kind of the fintech slash crypto segment, especially in the UK, we had worked with a couple of crypto companies in the last twelve months, again, account based account based marketing campaign. I think that again, probably you know, crypto is a little bit volatile, has in terms of, you know, focus and growth and so on. But I think that's probably, you know, another another segment that I've focused on. So start ups in Europe especially in tech, IT security, and and then fintech slash crypto. I would say primarily in the UK, eventually in Europe, but I think UK is the primary target.
Speaker 0: Amazing. Amazing. So startups in Europe, IT security, and fintech slash crypto. Yeah. So perfect. And I guess, at this point, the goal will be to get you in contact with more of these companies. Right? So you can have the productive business conversations, convert them into clients. And in terms of your sales process, would you be taking these calls or would it be someone else in team?
Speaker 1: Is primarily me. Then when we see that that there is a a kind of a specific interest also in the kind of in the reward for good offer that I mentioned before. Also, Jason, our managing director can attend because he is the one who really kind of, you know, created this offer. And it's his baby and so on. But let's say in in a hundred percent of the case, I will be on the on the phone or on Zoom meetings. And then eventually for a part of those, I can have Jason with me. But yeah.
Speaker 0: Fantastic. The reason I ask is just to make sure you guys have the capacity to take on, you know, whatever the influx, of course, maybe. But it seems that you have everything covered on that end. Correct?
Speaker 1: Yeah. And also, then again, we we have in our team. We have a couple of people that We have one expert also in the tech business. We have one in tech that has worked with all the fintech and financial markets clients. So eventually, those are people that can have, you know, conversations with clients as well.
Speaker 0: So that's amazing. Alright. Cool. So, I mean, just to recap what we spoke about so far, you're currently at around two hundred and fifty thousand per month. The goal is to get to five hundred thousand per month doubling. And the only thing stopping you from going from two fifty to five hundred is just signing more qualified clients. Right? So startups in in Europe, IT security, fintech slash crypto. If you can sign more of them, scale will be pretty much inevitable. So the only thing stopping you from signing clients is just having more productive conversations with them. Getting noticed, getting on to calls with them, and converting them because, generally, it seems like you have everything ready. In terms of, firstly, your background text, so you have a great understanding of it. But you also have, you know, a case that it was HP. You have other amazing case that it's too. And I definitely think you'll be able to convert them just based on your offer. So it really is just a matter of getting you in contact with these prospects. Would that sound reasonably close to your situation?
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's it's very close to the situation and and, at an additional point also is that we only have internal teams. So we do not outsource. The only thing that we outsource and we always say this upfront because we don't have those those, let's say, skills in house is that sales development rather. So if there are customers that there are very, very few, but it happened with three or four. If there are customers that say, no. No. No. No. I want of course, this is a this is a demand generation of things. I want leads, but I don't want marketing leads. I want kind of type of appointments or band qualified leads. In this case, we work with some partner agencies that we'll do this kind of the this last mile of human qualification because we don't have those skills. You know, we work with many, you know, intact. Even when you were for a security company, you need to be subbing security to have conversation with your clients. The same time, our doing artificial intelligence. And so we we can't have a team of SDRs that are fluent you know, in in all possible sectors, industries, and technologies. So that's why I the it's the only I would say, team that is not asked. But for the rest, the data team, the martech team, the creative team, the media team, they're all in in house. And and this is something that client likes because it's a one stop shop. So, you know, We can do a Sunday campaign, for example, from from end to end. We work on the creative. We can work on the on the paid media advertising, media activation,
Speaker 0: reporting. So it's basically it's it's a one stop shop. Hundred percent. I I definitely think the clients will love the fact that it's the one stop shop. You can get, you know, everything that they need in one place. So That's another just amazing silent one. And one of the last things that I want to ask is, I know where you are. I know where you want to go. But have you guys tried anything in the past to try and attract clients just so that, you know, I have the full idea?
Speaker 1: Nothing I think by now, your guess that I like. I like the word systematically. Nothing systematically. I know that before I joined, this company tried to to do some, for example, attending events -- Mhmm.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: buying, you know, kind of space at events, speaking opportunities, boots and so on, again, with our kind of managing director as a speaker. I think that we also tried. Again, I'm saying, I think because it's before I joined, sometimes it's speed dating as well that we're not kind of, you know, very successful, you know, speed dating when you you have fifteen minutes to, you know, present who you are and the value that you bring, and then you can have a follow-up and so on. But I get that's the only thing that that was done. Right. But nothing nothing more than that. So no. It's a Got it.
Speaker 0: So nothing systematic and that just leaves the fact that you guys are growing almost purely off of your network and referrals.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Also, when I joined since I, you know, I I know relatively well the world of tech I brought in also some, you know, tech tech clients, not not because I'm particularly good, but because you know, I I knew some companies. I knew what they were looking for in terms of marketing. And I said, you know, now I work for this agency. You know, if if you're interested, we can have a conversation. But of course, you know, that you cannot run a business only on personal network. Right? So because at some point. But first of all, the personal networks isn't really predictable. Yep. At a certain point, you know, it it kind of dries out. So you you can't you can't just run the business this, you know, this way. So
Speaker 0: -- Yeah. -- hundred percent. You only have so many friends. That's great.
Speaker 1: And also if you have good friends, you know, not not all of them might have projects, you know, all the time, you know, for YouTube. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. So in that case, just to summarize everything we spoke about, I mean, it seems like you genuinely have all the foundations ready. And the only thing stopping you from going from two hundred and fifty to five hundred thousand per month is just signing four clients. But signing these clients in a systematic, predictable method. Right? Because we don't want it to be sporadic, you know, all over the place like from personal networks. If we can just get you in contact with your ideal prospects of startups, IT security, fintech, predictably, and systematically, then I mean, scaling up pretty straightforward. And if that's the case, you're probably like ninety nine percent of our clients. So do you mind if I share what the next steps would be? Sure.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. So based on what you told me, genuinely, you seem like an amazing fit. And what we do is we help established marketing agencies to increase the revenue by fifty, one hundred, many cases, two to three hundred per month within six to nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right? They usually have everything that they need already sorted out. So they're usually growing from referrals, which just indicates a great service. They're usually great at what they do. They have the systems. They have smart team members. They have the case studies, they have everything we need to leverage, to help them get notice, to help them book meetings, to help them have you know, business conversations with the ideal prospects. And once we can solve this one problem, like, mainly just this one problem of getting them in contact with their ideal prospects, scale becomes inevitable. Right? Because it's it's quite straightforward. So based on that, would you be open to scheduling a follow-up or where I can create a customized proposal on exactly how we think we can help you reach five hundred k a month based on what you told me today?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And for for me, Anthony, what will be important is to understand. So how you do that? Not not asking you to share the kind of the the the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or the recipe, but just say, okay. This is how we operate. So this is how we do. What are the tactics techniques that we use, you know, to fit your your pipeline. And then, of course, yeah, your your pricing schemes, so how how you, you know, how do you walked this this work and
Speaker 0: that. Absolutely. And for some context, higher use of this proposal is to explain exactly that. So to give some context, we always start with going through, firstly, a ton of case studies. Just so you have an idea of who we've helped, what the outcomes they received work, then we go into our entire process where we explain start to finish exactly how we do what we do, and why it's different from every single other, you know, lead gen agency that offers similar things. And then into our pricing and additional details, how to get started, things like that. Would that be okay with you?
Speaker 1: Yeah. That would be okay.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Amazing. So in terms of booking tomorrow's call or the follow-up call. Would tomorrow at the same time as this call would be?
Speaker 1: Tomorrow is problematic, actually, because I'm off in the afternoon. Can we do it early next week? And then when you say very low?
Speaker 0: Course, what I'll do is I'll send over scheduling it. If it's mine, can you just let me know if any of these times worked here? And if so, we can book it in that way. If not, I'll move something around for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Then I'll I'll I'll I'll Let me have a look directly. So Yeah. No. I think should I book already? For Monday. Monday eleven CET, that's fine with me.
Speaker 0: If possible, yes. That would be great.
Speaker 1: Yep. So okay. Okay. And Yep. Schedule.
Speaker 0: Amazing. Alright. I'm looking forward to it. And again, like I mentioned in this proposal call, will be going through our entire process, case studies, and all the other details that you'll need to know. And between now and them, either myself or someone else in the team will reach out just to confirm everything, make sure everything's okay, and we'll go from there. But I would love to It was great speaking to you. Very interesting to you.
Speaker 1: Why is ethan? Thanks thanks for your time and look look forward to our next discussion.
Speaker 0: Amazing. I'll talk to you on Monday. Have a good weekend.
