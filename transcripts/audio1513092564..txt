Speaker 0:  Jay, my friend. How are you? Doing great. How are you?
Speaker 1: Yes. Not too bad. Not too bad.
Speaker 0: Excellent. Sorry for the weekend.
Speaker 1: Yes. Good. Good shoulder.
Speaker 0: That's great.
Speaker 1: A little bit useful.
Speaker 0: Alright. Great. Great. I had some calls like this on the weekend. I love these calls. So good weekend. But, yeah, if you're ready, we can get straight into it.
Speaker 1: Yeah, man. Yeah, I can.
Speaker 0: Sure. So how these calls usually go is I just wanna ask some questions about your business, see where you are, where you wanna be, then if it sounds like we're we're a good fit and it sounds like I can help you, then I'll explain the service and how it works. Then at the end, you can make easy decision. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 1: Yeah, man. Nice. Cool.
Speaker 0: Cool. So Jay, tell me, what made you wanna come on this call today?
Speaker 1: Well, I think want to know a little bit more about what you do, like, as an appointments there. Mhmm. Like, right now, I'm just doing most of my I've done all day to reach myself. So it'd be good to see, like, what your processes and, you know, like, at one point or another, I would like to fill it, like, outsource this part of the business, and because it is very time consuming. So, yeah, that's basically main reasons.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And by the end of this call, like, after I answer all the questions, I'll explain, you know, the entire service, how it works, all of that. So how's the outage going?
Speaker 1: It's it's hard. It's it's okay some days. It's like, you know, you'll go like a little bit and you get nothing back. Like, absolutely nothing. And then you'll have, like, a day where you might be, like, booked three or four meetings. But it's, like, it's not consistent. And It's just it's just one of those things I guess. Like, right now, I'll mainly just do an email and lengthen every reach. And But I was basically doing me. No worries. I'm doing it right now.
Speaker 0: Yeah. A lot of people tell me that inconsistency is so demotivating. Getting nothing on Sundays. It feels like a waste
Speaker 1: of time.
Speaker 0: Like, it was I
Speaker 1: think it's the late the especially the best email it reaches. It's, like, really scalable, which is good. And, like, once you get a process done, it can really work. But right now, that I've got, like, one of my clients, he says that he gets, like, maybe, like, ten to fifteen emails per day. By people that's doing the exact same service. So, like, it's really hard to, like, stand out. And I think that's the the main thing with email was, you know, you're just getting put an analyst with another bunch of people that's pitching the exact same services. Yeah.
Speaker 0: That's true. Am I right in saying that you offer paid ads?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Paid ads. So we primarily do Facebook ads. But we're we do, like, some YouTube and Google ads as well. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And how do you price for services?
Speaker 1: So it depends, like, right now, we've only we've only got two clients right now, but one of the clients is on, like, a robust only deal. So we just take a percentage just like ten percent of return on ad spend on Facebook ads. And then the other person, we've got them on YouTube, Google, and Facebook. And that's our first six hundred and fifty pound retainer.
Speaker 0: Will your prices stay like this? Or do you have something in mind?
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. They'll probably stay like that. They stay the same. So normally. Normally, our way the way that I do is when I jump on the call with someone, I don't make up the place their name, but the price is pretty fluid. And then, like, I'll wait and see how much they want to spend on ads. And if there's room to do, like, a raw steel, I would prefer to do that because, like, when we get the the other game scaled up, it's better for me, obviously. And -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: and a lot of people prefer, like, the the performance basis as well because there's, like, a lot agencies that are just, like, taking big chunky retainers and they don't really they don't really care about the that show service delivery. So -- Mhmm.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: but it's pitching them on, like, a a performance deal. They they tend to prefer it.
Speaker 0: True. And what does the ideal customer look like?
Speaker 1: So right now e commerce businesses, preferably with, like, a revenue between fifteen and twenty five k, roughly about that. And they sell, like, basic, anything, e commerce related, anything product related. I was pretty much trying to stay away from my end full product.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. So can you tell me about your sales process?
Speaker 1: So the full sales process from email outreach, a specific email outreach, we'll send the email once they book a call is back, like, yourself with the link, then we'll send them over and ask them if they prefer a time or we'll send over the calendar invite. Once we jump on at the call, we just it's kinda like what we're done here. We'll just run through the where they are in the business right now. We really want to get to that's pretty much just trying to build up a little bit of a relationship with them. And then go through the service that we provide. And, yeah, that's pretty much true. It's I've got like a structure in the calls, but I tend not to just stick to the structure to like, regular stuff. That makes sense. We just try and, like, build up of a bit of a relationship and just chat to the business owner. And then I'll I'll have, like, certain hoops that we'll need to jump through if you're I'll ask them about the revenue, ask them about the profit margins and all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So right now, you said you're using email and LinkedIn How else do you currently get customers? Was that the only way?
Speaker 1: That's the only way right now.
Speaker 0: So this including that, do you have a system or process that you use to get customers consistently?
Speaker 1: No. Not really. That's basically it. So it's just all outbound outreach.
Speaker 0: Okay. That's fine. So would you be comfortable in saying that Outreach and client acquisitions, the biggest bottleneck in the business?
Speaker 1: Definitely. Yep.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. So now I just wanna understand exactly where you are and exactly where you wanna be using some sort of metrics. So how much money are you currently making per month for this business right now?
Speaker 1: Probably around twelve twelve hundred pounds.
Speaker 0: Cool. And in twelve months time, what's the goal?
Speaker 1: Ten thousand.
Speaker 0: Ten thousand? Nice. What's your motivation?
Speaker 1: Just like the the ability to just work for myself, basically. And, like, choose when and how I work and, obviously, I have an Aflex validate to, like, go on holidays whenever I want or, you know, basically, I work on Math. I I can take calls when I want to. I can work when I want to. Obviously, right now, it's not like that. It's I'm working even more than I was in my last job, but That is the motivation and that's where I want to get the
Speaker 0: freedom. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Makes it out.
Speaker 0: Cool. And how would the business change at ten thousand dollars a month?
Speaker 1: So hopefully, by I want to bring on some day about five k to handle some of the other accounts. I'm hoping that if I can get an average of around around six hundred and fifty pounds per client. By the time that I get to five k, I'll be, like, totally start out, I won't be able to do anything. It would just be as accounts all day. So hopefully bring on media buyer at that point. And then, yeah, just keep on buying and getting hopefully, have k a two media buyer run by the time we get to ten k -- Mhmm.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: and, like, a couple of years just to do some, like, admin stuff and that's pretty much it. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. A lot of agency owners say, telling me that their big goal is to transition into more than owner. Instead of working in the business, they wanna work on the business, automate a lot of lead gen. Would that be the same for you?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Right now, like, with my lead gen, that's like another thing. It's I pay for, like, a thousand leads and that costs me three hundred pounds. Wow. And don't get me wrong, like, I've I've paid Like, there's loads of different lead generation people that I've used, and they like, the first one that I had, they were sending me, like, contact details for, like, Tiffany and Co. And I was like, oh my god. Where is this? Yeah. They and but the the leads were pretty pretty shut, to be honest with him. But this guy is, like, he goes through an old check, like, how many adds the runner on Facebook. So it does take about time, but it's the price that I'm paying. And if I if I'm paying three hundred pounds for a thousand leads, you know, I expect to get a bunch of meetings from that. And right now, like, the meeting birthday is for every hundred leads I get. As maybe one. I think it's, like, point seven percent. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And that's just a meeting.
Speaker 1: That's just a meeting. Yep.
Speaker 0: Yeah. I definitely wanna talk on that a bit later. Yeah. Yeah. So ten thousand dollars a month. Sounds great. How would it impact other areas of your life?
Speaker 1: I mean, if we got to there, I mean, that's just, like, It would be a proper life changing, you know. It would be just
Speaker 0: yeah.
Speaker 1: Take my girlfriend to whatever she wants to go, treat my family. Like, that's that's the, you know, it'd be like completely financial security.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's a agency dreamer.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 0: That's nice. So you're currently at twelve hundred, you wanna get to ten thousand. What do you think stopping you from getting that on your own?
Speaker 1: I think it's a bunch of different stuff. One thing is obviously the client acquisition part of it. The I would say that's the main thing. It's not me getting clients, basically. The for them and I've worked that up in or in Outreach, feel like the the results aren't really should be. I'm not sure if it's done to, like, the systems or just the competitive nature of the business because there's absolutely hundreds of agencies over there. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. So I just have a few more questions. So you currently have twelve hundred. Why not just continue and stay where you are?
Speaker 1: If I continue and still with Alarm, I'll probably need to go back and get another job because I'm a like, right now, it's, like, that's just covering, like, the bows.
Speaker 0: You
Speaker 1: know, it's, like, right on the edge. So I I I basically can't stay around.
Speaker 0: Must be pretty stressed on it.
Speaker 1: Definitely.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Have been that that's where I can relate. But anyways, when do you wanna fix this problem?
Speaker 1: M basically as soon as possible.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. Well, based on your answers, based on what you told me, I definitely think that I could help you with this.
Speaker 1: Would you
Speaker 0: like me to tell you a bit more about what we do?
Speaker 1: Yeah, man. I'll just go for it.
Speaker 0: Cool. So at my company, Our area of expertise is helping agency owners to get more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. The ideal agency for us to work with is typically just starting out or between zero and seven thousand dollars per month with the goal of getting to somewhere between nine and thirty thousand dollars per month. Typically, these agency owners do everything in the business themselves. They're doing sales. They're doing service delivery. They're doing outreach. So we are going to free up time or to make lead generation and take more of an ownership role, which usually gives them a lot more freedom than they have before. So based on what you told me, I definitely think you'd be a phenomenal fit for what we're doing. Yep. You have any questions?
Speaker 1: No. Yeah. That's not you touched on there about the freedom part and working on their business. Like, the ideal part would be just and short very short term what I would like to do. Like, right now, it's like you said, to all out of each sales, everything. Like, right now, what I would love to do is just have meetings, then service delivery. Meetings, service delivery. That is the the short term goal.
Speaker 0: That's great. Yeah. That's the figure I could help them to do.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: Say anything else?
Speaker 1: Sorry. Did you ask sorry. Did you ask a question now?
Speaker 0: No? No. No. Usually, people just usually after I tell them a bit more about what we do, they usually have questions. So I'm just, like, in case you have anything you want to know.
Speaker 1: Nah. Just I'm interested to know, like, what the what your your methods are, like, of actually getting the the calendars booked and, like, filled up.
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah. No problem. Yeah. I'll explain the entire process. Wonderful. We've got time. So we'll start. Okay. Let's start at the beginning. This service was created with one goal in mind. To get you more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings with prospects in huge need to be service, So we'll start by creating a new offer and designing unique messaging that will stand out from the hundreds and thousands of other agencies. And attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll utilize this messaging and highly personalized outreach campaigns where we'll target in book meetings with the most qualified prospect. Plus is completely organic, meaning we don't have to pay any money on ads or funnels or anything like that. So in addition to this, The entire process from start to finish is completely done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up to calls with qualified prospects and just sell them on services that they clearly one. Yeah. And, yeah, the entire service was designed by by an agency owner, four agency owners looking to break through and systematize the outreach.
Speaker 1: Perfect. The when you use the as a as a email or as a LinkedIn or do you have, like, another another way that you do it?
Speaker 0: We use a combination of email and LinkedIn.
Speaker 1: Perfect. And in terms of, like, monthly like, targets for new guys. Like, how much how many how many we'd do will you guys contact and, like, say, a month?
Speaker 0: You wanna know how many we contact or how many meetings we expect?
Speaker 1: Like, how many how many leads you with contact?
Speaker 0: It varies because we can scale the service up and down. So it's it's variable in that in that space. But I don't know if you saw I changed my LinkedIn recently to up to add our new offer. Updated off of that. We've been running for months now. Right. This gives a bit more detail where we expect fifteen to thirty five meetings. Within the first sixty or thirty days. So within sixty to thirty days, we expect to see between fifteen and thirty five meetings per month.
Speaker 1: Right. Perfect. Right now, I'm getting, like, an average of, what, two weeks. So Two or three a week, maybe. So, like, six. So that's way more. Where is that in your LinkedIn? Or is it just what you said doing, basically?
Speaker 0: Basically, what I said. I just updated my profile. Like, we've been running with this offer for months now. I just never changed it.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So what is the what is the price? I I noticed that you guys have got the the paper results. So what's obviously, I know that would be quite hard for, like, your business model because if it's paid per per results is that paid on meetings or does that?
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah. My favorite question. So, yeah, it's paid per meeting. Similarly to how you guys do ROS. So only when you get meetings with qualified prospects you pay, but I should explain the entire pricing. It'll make more sense. So a fee for building and managing the system is a one time setup fee of one thousand five hundred dollars From there, it's one hundred percent completely pay on results. So you only pay when qualified prospects show up to the calls. And from this one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.
Speaker 1: Right. And the one so the one time service fee, that's like that's not like or that's just one month?
Speaker 0: Yeah. One month. Right. One time. Yeah.
Speaker 1: And I suppose I and, like, that would that's full, like, lead generation. Totally. Oh, I mean, you guys take care of them.
Speaker 0: Yeah. You literally just have to show up the calls.
Speaker 1: Sounds good, man. It does sound good. Well, hey, how how many guys you use? What number three? No. If you got, like, I don't know what it's a case studies because it's not, like, a case study, but, like, results that you've gotten with an agency so far
Speaker 0: Well, based on the offer that I mentioned, fifteen to thirty five, this is based on what we've seen. So when you first started, it was just we help you get meetings. But now it's we have some data behind it. Yep. That's what we see. And as you know, with the cumulative nature of the digital marketing space, this is why we can't actually post clear testimonials of our clients.
Speaker 1: Yes. Because
Speaker 0: our competitors knew where to look. They could literally just, you know, copy it. So yeah.
Speaker 1: Sounds good, man. That sounds good. The only problem I have right now is, obviously, revenue. It's hard because I really do I do it.
Speaker 0: Now, this has happened in the past, and because of this, we've created a a semi system that might be helpful to you. Do you want me to explain that?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: So instead of paying the entire full on setup fee today, What we've done in the past is we've allowed our clients to split it up into two or three months if that's required. So instead of one thousand five hundred dollars today, it could be seven fifty over two months or five hundred over three months. Mhmm. Perfect.
Speaker 1: I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest. I'll probably not be able to make a decision right now, but really interested. I would probably just need to go and think about yeah. Actually, the payments and because there's way obviously, I want as many meetings as I possibly can. And, like, I'm quick. Like, obviously, the service like, the one time service fee sounds good as well, but It's just, like, the overseas is is, like, amazing that the meeting is a hundred dollars, which is really good. You know what I mean? Because that's, like, for lifetime value for me, if I close that client, that was gonna be You know, I mean, like Exactly. Yeah. And
Speaker 0: So it wouldn't take much to make back your investment.
Speaker 1: No. Definitely not.
Speaker 0: And mhmm.
Speaker 1: Last night. I'm probably gonna need to think about it, but I'm really interested. I would just need to go and sort out how many like, how much it would cost, like, because if if we paid the say, we did split it up in the three months. For the for that service fee. But then on top of that, see how see you do something and then, like, there I've got, like, fifteen meetings. It's, like, the initial payment of the hundred dollars per meeting, if that makes sense. You know what I mean? Be faint once I've got, like, say, I've seen up to them. You know what I mean? Yeah.
Speaker 0: And If you'd like, we could since we I should explain that we once you sign up, we have, like, twenty four seven communication. You can message me at any time. So if you really need, we can slow things down or speed things up depending on what you'd prefer.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 0: I got a message at any time.
Speaker 1: Right. So I like, if we were doing something like that and you're, like, like, if we could probably make your job a lot easier as well. Instead, they're, like, they can, like, say, fifty meters or, like, what if we aim for, like, ten? Do you know what I mean? And then That sounds good, man. And listen, I'm gonna It's already I forgot how I think about this.
Speaker 0: How long do you need?
Speaker 1: Probably I could Probably just today. I've got yeah. I probably just today. If I give you a message tomorrow, and we could probably just jump on another call tomorrow if you're free.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So do we find that we can schedule a follow-up call for tomorrow?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. That's cool, man. If you you want me to send do you wanna send me another account in the little link?
Speaker 0: Yeah. No problem. I'll send it to LinkedIn right now.
Speaker 1: No worries.
Speaker 0: Same time for it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Same times go with me.
Speaker 0: Perfect. And since you have me here, Do you have any questions?
Speaker 1: I'm more trying to think. So because so I've got two quenched right now. And, unfortunately, the both of them have so I've had to I've had SINA and NDA with them. So we don't actually have, like, a a case study. Would that be a problem?
Speaker 0: It would affect the results.
Speaker 1: But, yeah,
Speaker 0: are you able to Do you think you'd be able to just use their result? Don't have to mention many names. Just the number.
Speaker 1: I can definitely speak to them and and see what we can do. I also I'll jump on a call with one of them later on today. And see if we can just use the results. They were really funny about it for some reason. That's, like, that's one of the things that it's it's just so weird because it doesn't have anything to do with them. You know what I mean? Yeah. I was like, oh, block out all the ads and everything. They're like, boom.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So because this happens a lot, I've had a couple of clients in the past where we couldn't use the actual name of the brand, but we just use the numbers. And that helped a lot more than using nothing.
Speaker 1: Yep. Definitely. They you see her so when you're when you were saying that you work with people that are just starting up as well, how do you structure that? They don't have any clients for any results.
Speaker 0: So like I said in the first point, we completely create a new offer that's extremely appealing. And -- Yep. -- a lot of the times have done work in the past. So they are able to add some sort of guarantee. If I had no guarantee, no case study just starting out, I probably wouldn't take them on. But since they have experience and they can guarantee something, it's still able to get meetings.
Speaker 1: What a what kind of guarantees do you do? Like, right now, like, some of the my email I reached have, like, split it up and then I was saying some leads I guarantee and then some leads I don't and, like, so the guarantee that I was doing was, like, a a return on investment within within one month or you don't pay the service fee. So, like, do you build the offer? Is it structured similar to that?
Speaker 0: Similarly, yeah. We have a entire framework for creating a new guarantee.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 0: So I'll show you that as soon as you sign up. We get started on that. Because that helps so much in -- Yeah. -- meeting meetings. You're offering
Speaker 1: a guarantee. Yeah. I can imagine. No. That sounds good, man. What else was it gonna say though? Or do you so in terms of, like, just booking a meeting that I need to have jumping on a call where, like, an appointment set up before neighbors want me to create, like, a VSO. Do do you guys do anything like that? Or Is that something that you would do that is not like needed?
Speaker 0: It's not needed. It in the future, I was actually this is actually part of the six month plan. I was planning on implementing that as an optional thing for clients. Because it would it would speed things up. But to start off, I would always do completely organic just to get a proof of concept first.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. That makes sense. That makes sense. That's good morning. Perfect. No. I think that's pretty much it. I would just go only to kinda look at the figures and, hopefully, I can move forward with this because it does sound good.
Speaker 0: But I'm I'm so excited at the possibility of helping you out.
Speaker 1: Yeah. As a good one. It's just, like, the obviously, like, what you're saying is basically exactly what I want, like, just to be able to jump on calls, book people in, So with a minute, do the service delivery because, like, outreach is I'm probably doing, like, like, crazy numbers of overreach right now.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: And that's I I know that it the results could definitely be better. But yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. It's it's the natural progression of an agency owner. Like, at some point or another, you're gonna outsource the outreach. So why don't you just do it
Speaker 1: at the start? Yeah. Exactly.
Speaker 0: Like, save yourself all the pain of unresponded messages.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. I get it, man. That's cool. Perfect, man. Right. Well, listen. I will let you go right now, and I'll I'll book an for tomorrow. And just at the same time, and I'll speak to you tomorrow.
Speaker 0: Yeah, man. It was great meeting you. Great speaking to you. Really looking forward to it.
Speaker 1: Perfect, man. Thank you very much.
Speaker 0: All the best.
