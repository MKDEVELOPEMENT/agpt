Speaker 0:  No. Hey, Ethan. How's it going, brother?
Speaker 1: Hey. Doing great. Doing great. How are you?
Speaker 0: Oh, doing well, man. Doing well. What's happening today?
Speaker 1: I've been busy. Been busy. We've got a few new clients on. So getting them on board and got some new team members on too. That's been fun. How about you?
Speaker 0: Yeah, man. It's it's a busy day for me too. We're doing lots of meetings.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Looks like you're in a nice lake. You know what it is?
Speaker 0: Yeah. No. It's not a bummer, man. It's there's a lake right over my shoulder back there. So, yeah, it's pretty nice.
Speaker 1: Oh, man. So it's not actually just one of the Zoom backgrounds, actually a real
Speaker 0: big. No. It's yeah. I'm actually outside.
Speaker 1: That's great. That's great. I was looking forward to this conversation. I really wanted to see how we could potentially make something work If you're open to it, I can get us started with everything if you'd like.
Speaker 0: Go for it, brother.
Speaker 1: Easy, man. Alright. Cool. I was checking out your website. It looks like we're doing something relatively similar. I mean, how the calls usually go? I think, you know, I just wanna start off asking some quick questions. I'll be understanding where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially partner, help you get there. And also explain all the steps how it works and then answer any questions that you might have afterwards. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 0: Go for, man.
Speaker 1: Cool, man. Alright. So Dave, this place is start. What made you wanna take this call?
Speaker 0: Yeah. So it's actually for two of my other companies. So I'm with seven different companies. Avadel, which is the STR company. I'm actually selling that. And so I'm looking for some new appointment setters to be working with me. So the two brands that I'm looking to grow, one is called DHS. They do It's a graphic design and branding agency. They do unlimited design work. Mhmm. And so, literally, you pay them a flat fee. They'll do as many designs as you want within a month. And then the other one is called the drew agency quest. And so I've owned four different agencies, stole some, and I basically teach agency owners how to grow their agency and then be a hands off CEO. So like, hey, man. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to take sales calls. I don't have to do any of that kind of stuff. So allowing people to kinda like work into a space of freedom is what I do with those people. So for the Dream Agency Quest, the target agency owners that are doing two hundred thousand to one point five million in U. S. Dollar revenue in a year. And then with the VHS stuff, man, we work with pretty much companies that have twenty two upwards of five hundred employees. Consumer product goods are huge for us over there. Any kind of b to b service is big because they'll like handy to slide deck for the sales team. I need a PDF. I need Mhmm. So anything like that would also be great for that. So those are the two things that I looked for now.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. That's amazing. Just to recap, making sure I heard everything correctly, you can run seven companies right now. It's very impressive. And you're looking to grow firstly BHS. That's a branding and graphic design agency. Right. And then you're also looking to scale dream agency question. This is mainly towards agency owners helping them transition from working in the business doing all the day to day things to transition to really work on the business, you know, potentially stepping out, having it run by self automating system systemizing things. And the goal is to bypass the both of those.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That'd be great.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. And out of the two, is there a priority as to which one you look to scale more or is it like a fifty fifty thing?
Speaker 0: It's fifth to fifth thing, man. They're they're both they're both high ticket offers. And Yeah. They've they've got a lot of potential to grow and and kind of the way that they're both set up is we can work with anybody in the world on either one of those offers. So lots of lots of room and space to engage with people.
Speaker 1: Amazing. Oh, this is great. Okay. Cool. So just so we can put a number on it. Obviously, your goals scale it up. Let's say twelve months out, where you guys looking to get it.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So for BHS, So their starting baseline package, which is like a standard package for everybody, is five k a month. Mhmm. We'd love to by the end of this year, we'd love to have twenty or thirty of more of those clients. And then with the dream agency quest, man, we're we're looking to build a a community of agency owners. We've already got a number of people that are in on it. But we'd love to add another fifty to a hundred students to cohorts. Between now and this time next year. Really a hundred by this time next year would be ideal.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So BHS, you charge around five k a month. The goal is to add an extra twenty to thirty clients. That would put you, you know, adding an extra hundred to format is correct, hundred and fifty thousand per month. And the agent's request, that's fifty to a hundred extra students.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And so the way that that works, we kinda have two models. So one model is they they they finance a year. So your engagement is eighteen k, or they do a three year engagement. We give them all sorts of gear TEs and extra bonuses and stuff. We actually have a financing partner, but they only work inside the US. Mhmm. But that financing partner would make it so that they base we have the ability to finance the thirty five thousand upfront. So they get two years for the or they get three years for the price of two in that model.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Perfect. So it's around eighteen thousand for one year being accessed or getting access to community, the training, mentorship, things like that. Yep. Yep. That's it, man. Alright. That's cool. That's really cool. Alright. Cool. So just to recap, the goal would be to add around an for a hundred to a hundred and fifty to BHS. And for frame agency quests, there'll be around fifty to a hundred students at eighteen thousand per year. Alright? Nice. Okay. Cool. So for BHS, how far you guys from you know I mean, obviously, the goal is to add extra hundred to hundred and fifty weigh you guys right now. Oh, establishes it.
Speaker 0: Yeah. It's pretty established, man. So this is some remnants of a previous agency -- Mhmm. -- that I I owned. And so I when I sold that previous agency, there were some clients that they wanted to stick around. So I carved them out whenever we did the the agreement with the the buyer. And brought a designer with me, and she has become my partner. And so right now in that model, DHS is serving twelve different clients. So about sixty grand a month. And we are looking to scale it up, man, and kind of convert it into an even bigger agency because we've figured out systems processes, you know, way to way to get it down and really do it well. And so yeah, man. So we're looking to to grow that thing.
Speaker 1: I could Okay. That's perfect. So I mean, it's definitely not the case of you not knowing how to grow a business. You clearly have all the foundations there. You have the systems. You have the process. You probably have the team already. Probably done a case studies too. Only stopping from adding extra a hundred to a hundred and fifty, and then also the other students as well is just signing more clients.
Speaker 0: Honestly, man. Yeah. We we have a great close rate, brother. Yeah. But it's it's yeah. So, like, if we have a conversation on a cold outreach clothes, was that on average thirty percent across the board? Yep. I've got I've got a a head of sales that helps me with both VHS and the Dream Agency Quest stuff. So he and I tag team some of those calls. He's priority. So he takes all the meetings that he can. And then I am secondary on backup. Right? So so basically, what we're doing, Ethan, is Yeah. So we're looking to grow those just by booking more meetings, and that's that's really the thing.
Speaker 1: That's perfect. Yeah. I mean, it seems don't wanna say easy. I don't say that too often, but it seems very straightforward. It seems very simple. Right? We just need to help
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: It's straightforward. The only thing starts at adding more clients speaking to an out prospects. Alright. Perfect. So one of the last things I just wanna ask is just to get an idea of what you're currently doing. So in terms of attracting clients right now, what systems do you have in in process or in place to actually do that?
Speaker 0: Yeah. So the STR agency that I own, they are almost exclusively a cold email agency. And so that's how they're generating leads for themselves and for all the five of the other six companies that I own. And they do a good job with it, man. But what we're looking to do is is more stuff like what I experience through your appointment center, which is one to one marketing where we're having conversations via social media. And engaging in that space. We're just seeing we've been trying that out.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And we're seeing that it's really, really effective. And guys just happened to hit me up at the right time and we're having a conversation, man.
Speaker 1: So Right guy at the right time. It's almost like his intention is
Speaker 0: it, man. That's right.
Speaker 1: That's great. And I also think, just on that point, what we're finding for because we have a lot of clients doing similar things And -- Okay.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: what I'm finding is that the ones who get the best results have the best results. So with the three major quest, having that, like, reservoir of students and their results that can be used as quoted on the page for the one to one marketing is incredibly useful. Because if they do have any concerns, it's like, I hear you. But we help twelve other agency owners doing the exact same service and the exact same niche. And here's the test. Honestly, it's like, it's a new brainer, so that's perfect. Alright. Cool. I love it then. So the SDR agency is your main traffic source for these right now, and that's almost exclusively cold email marketing. On average, how many bookings are you getting per day for that?
Speaker 0: Yeah. So right now, for Dream Agency Quest, we're having, like, two a day for VHS. We're having two to three a day. Mhmm. But we would like to see those numbers increase. So we figured out a while ago, like, Giv, who's my head of sales. He can take twenty five to thirty meetings a week. No problem. And then I could do the same. If if we need to. So that's kinda what we are aiming to do, man.
Speaker 1: That's both. That's what I like to hear because a lot of the agencies that we have, they may be relatively smaller, but what we find is that they're the only ones taking the calls. So when we do get the initial inflow, it's like, great. This is amazing. Keep going. Okay. Now we're fully booked. Gotta stop everything. It's like, guys. We just stop We we could
Speaker 0: yeah. We could take fifty meetings a week, man. No problem.
Speaker 1: That is perfect. Alright. Cool. That's great to hear. And besides email, is there anything else that you guys are leveraging?
Speaker 0: We've we've done some direct mail, so, like, sending physical items in the mail. Yeah. And we've we've had some success with that as well. We'll we'll probably keep doing that all still. We have a good relationship with a vendor that will engage with us on that. So Yeah, man.
Speaker 1: That's cool. And honestly, the the last thing that I wanted to ask is I know that your goal is to leverage the, you know, one to one marketing having the conversations by potentially social media, whatever it might be. Why do you actually wanna make that transition as opposed to just, for example, scaling up the email campaigns?
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, a big reason for this this push is we are selling off the SDR firm. And so as part of my non compete, I'm not going to be able to to run those anymore even for myself, which is fine. But the other thing that we've noticed to Ethan is when you're doing cold email outreach, you're always fighting with deliverability. Mhmm. And so and and you can do things that will make it work But to get it to scale, it it it poses challenges. And so we're looking for new ways to stand out. One of the other things that have a two d thing in that industry, one of the reasons that led me to sell -- Yeah. -- is that there's a lot of people that have entered into that market. And so when I got into it, when I sold my first agency and then started the SDR firm, that was August of twenty nineteen. There wasn't anyone in that space, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: I mean, there were there were people in that space So there were not a lot of people in that space. And so yeah, man. So we're just trying to flip up the game here a little bit and and find something new and fresh that people have not saturated, and they haven't been saturated the one to one marketing space yet.
Speaker 1: Absolutely. And Just a quick note that what what we'd be noticing, what you said about deliverability is completely right. It's almost like with email, the more you do, the more difficult it becomes, just with the deliverability. Right. But with Instagram or Facebook, the more you do the easier it gets because of the components -- Right.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: holding your network and the content and the social group, everything there. So by focusing on the, you know, the social platform, you get a a lot more leverage as opposed to just messing a new prospect every day. Yeah. And I'd love to go into more detail because we actually leverage the two together. Right?
Speaker 0: So beautiful.
Speaker 1: Use yeah. So using the the speed and the volume that you can get from the outbound email. Combine that with the, like, the social aspects, the content, the the leverage, the being able to make one post and a piece seen by a thousand people. So, I mean, based on this, it seems like the biggest problem you're facing right now is just adding more clients. Right? To go from way up to way you wanna be adding extra hundred, hundred and fifty per month and signing the students. It's just a matter of signing more clients. And The only thing stopping from signing more clients
Speaker 0: is it, man.
Speaker 1: More people. Right? You guys can definitely close. So that's the case, and I guess you're, like, ninety nine. That's all clients. So do you mind if I share some info what the next steps would be?
Speaker 0: Go for it, man.
Speaker 1: Cool. So again, based on what you told me, you seem like a a great fit. And to give a quick overview of what we do, you know, we typically partner with established marketing agencies. To help increase revenue by fifty hundred k per month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right, across the board, across every niche, across every industry, is just being able to create a system that predictably and reliably brings in new clients. Right? You clearly have all the foundations in place. You know you run seven businesses. So you know how to build it. You know how to structure it. You know how to implement the systems, the process of the team. And you have all the results, you have the testimonials, the social proof. It's just a matter of getting in contact with more of them. Like, that is literally it. So if we can do that, then scale will be pretty much inevitable. Right? And like I was saying, we like to leverage a combination of you know, direct messaging through email. That gets us a ton of volume, a ton of scale, but also leveraging this with ways that you can actually bold your brand and have that compounding effect in terms of posting content, building up your audience, and actually owning the audience in the first place so you can leverage that over and over. So based on that, Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal on exactly what I, you know, mentioned today, what we spoke about?
Speaker 0: Sure, ma'am.
Speaker 1: Amazing. Alright. Well, I'm just gonna bring up my calendar and we'll see if there's any good times. Would tomorrow, but an hour later work here.
Speaker 0: No. I've got meetings going until I've got meetings going until five thirty eastern time tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Got it. Okay. What I'll do is I will send over a scheduling link. So we don't have to -- Oh. -- battleship with our calendar, and then
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Perfect. -- secure those time book. And if they don't, I'll just move some things around here. Alright. Cool.
Speaker 0: Cool, man. I think that probably my next best available will be Friday, honestly. Do you have anything in there?
Speaker 1: At this point, these meetings every day, but Hopefully, some of these times work. That's fine. Cool. Perfect. Just let me know if they don't work. Yeah, man. Let me see what you got.
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna be in Pacific Time on Friday. Mhmm. Do you have anything later? Because the the latest one that I see in there is four thirty AM. K.
Speaker 1: Fair enough. Yeah. I can free some up here. I'll just adjust the
Speaker 0: I'll get up early because where where are you at, Ethan?
Speaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now.
Speaker 0: Oh, beautiful, man. Yeah, dude. If I need to get up earlier just to be able to kinda not make you stay up super late? I'm down to do that, man.
Speaker 1: We can definitely meet the middle. I'm happy to stay up. It's not a problem. Alright. Let's see.
Speaker 0: Okay.
Speaker 1: Okay. How about this one? Give me the middle.
Speaker 0: Perfect. These are these are great. Let's do this right here, man. Alright, man. Just scheduled for nine AM Pacific Friday.
Speaker 1: Imagined. Alright. Dave, it was an absolute pleasure speaking and to just give some contact while back. Between now and Friday, Either myself or someone else and the team will reach out, just confirm everything, check out this call went probably. And then on that call, what we'll do is we'll firstly go through a kind of case studies of other agencies that we have. Our exact process for getting these results would recommend, and then all the additional details like how to get started, things like that afterwards. Okay with you?
Speaker 0: Sounds great, man.
Speaker 1: Amazing. Dave was amazing speaking, and I'll talk to you very soon.
Speaker 0: Likewise, bro. Gotcha.
