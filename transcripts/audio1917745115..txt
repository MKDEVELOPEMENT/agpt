Speaker 0:  Hello?
Speaker 1: Hello? How are you?
Speaker 0: Hi. Oh, one second. Hold on. My earbuds are not on.
Speaker 1: No problem.
Speaker 0: Uh-huh. Okay.
Speaker 1: All good?
Speaker 0: Yes. I hear you. Okay. Nice to meet you.
Speaker 1: Likewise. How are you?
Speaker 0: I'm good. How are you?
Speaker 1: Very good. I have to say you win the award for the best zoom background this month.
Speaker 0: Thank you. I get that all the time. Thanks. Yeah. I'm I'm always doing live trainings workshops on Zoom with clients. So it's yeah. I've had this for a few years now. Thank you.
Speaker 1: And imagine, I'll send the trophy over soon. Is Gina the correct pronunciation?
Speaker 0: It is. Yeah. Just spelled with two m's. Yeah. It's spelled different.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Fair enough. Alright. Cool, Gina. I was looking forward to the call. Really wanted to see how we could potentially help you out. So if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you'd like.
Speaker 0: Well, why don't you tell me more about it? I've I've had just a little bit of time to go through your YouTube videos. Because today's I almost had to reschedule, but I didn't want to. So so why don't you tell me what you offer? Yeah. And yeah. And then we can talk about going from there.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. So to give a quick overview as to what we do, not I'll just assume you haven't been able to look at any of the stuff is that we help establish marketing agencies typically increase revenue by fifty to one hundred k per month within around sixty nine And the absolute biggest problem that we help to solve is client acquisition. Right? So I speak to agency owners every single day and the most common thing that I hear and the most common thing, you know, that they struggle with is just predictably acquiring clients. And usually, they have all the foundations in place already. Meaning they know how to deliver. They have happy clients, they have case studies, they have false results, they have everything there, team member systems, they're just not able to sign clients predictably. And usually the biggest thing stopping it from doing this is, you know, getting in contact with their audio prospects. So once they to speak to their ideal prospects every single day, you know, sales making sales signing clients becomes pretty much inevitable. And that's really what I wanted to discuss on this call. And how they usually go is just wanna start off with all sorts of quick questions, help me understand, you know, where you are, where you wanna be, and if we could potentially help you get there. Obviously, if you see good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works, and a lot more detail on this. And then go from there. Is that okay?
Speaker 0: Okay. Yep. Perfect.
Speaker 1: Amazing. Alright. Cool. So Gina, what made you wanna take the call in the first place?
Speaker 0: Those struggles that you're talking about primarily. So A lot of okay. So there's two sides to my business, my agency, which has been around since two thousand nine, all pretty much referral based.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 0: Yeah. And then over the last five years or so, I also do coaching and mentoring ships. So I have a couple mastermind programs that I run. So because I've built my teams, they were a team of ten to twelve just depends on our projects. It's given me more time to focus on my mastermind client. With that said, I still have the agency and I still wanna continue to grow that. So my focus is so heavily me personally. My focus has been so heavily on bringing in more clients into my mastermind. And you know what? One second. My Zoom just I have an issue with my Zoom that it blocks out for a second, and I need to switch from my phone and back to my laptop. I don't know why. So you can probably see me, but I can't see you. Hold on one second. I'm gonna do a quick quick switch. But I can keep talking. So, basically, as an agency, I would say that we're roughly we average between forty to sixty thousand a month in revenue. And that's, you know, consistent revenue. But I obviously would like to grow that to to grow that to a hundred k mux. Right? And so I personally don't have the time to be finding leads. I do have somebody on my team. I have an assistant. She's been doing a lot inside of LinkedIn and funneling people into Apollo. And so that just literally started, like, two weeks ago. But it's still there's still a lot of, like, things that I need to do, right, to get it set up and get going. So I really am looking and I have been thinking about bringing on, like, a salesperson, something like that. So I've been looking for something similar to what you offer. So, yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.
Speaker 1: That's great. That's great. So just so I know I heard everything correctly, currently you're running the agency, but you also have a coaching and, you know, an entire mastermind. The agency is doing forty thousand and sixty thousand per month. You have a team around ten to twelve people. That's great. And great body is that your agency is growing almost purely on referrals. Which just indicates that when your clients love you very much and they're referring to other people.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And our clients typically and you know what I can Oh, I didn't switch. Our clients typically are with us for at least four or five years.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 0: And we only you know, I will only take on a certain amount of planes and certain who I take on as a client. So can you hear me okay?
Speaker 1: Just a bit quiet.
Speaker 0: How about now? Hold on. Let me I'm sorry. I'm having all these technical issues right now. It's probably because I switched. So let me check my audio settings. Okay. How about now? Am I good? Yeah.
Speaker 1: It's better. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Okay. So, yeah, our clients are, you know, pretty long term. My retainers are a minimum of a year. Like, know, it's an annual contract to work with us. Usually, sometimes they make some, you know, depends on depends on what we have going on. Like, if I'm like, okay. Look, I really wanna work with them. I'll I'll do a six month contract. But yeah. So our clients are they're long term clients. And so, yeah, that's why we get a lot of referrals. And I don't always take on new clients. Like, right now, I'm in the position I have two proposals out for two more agency clients. As we bring on more clients, I'm ready to hire more. Too. So that's I'm always open to hiring more and growing and expanding that way.
Speaker 1: Got it. That's amazing. So is the reason for not, you know, hiring more people because of the limitation in terms of predicting on clients if you have to bring on clients to buy more people?
Speaker 0: Right. Got it.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. That's amazing. So you add around forty to sixty k right now. What's the goal there? Let's say twelve months up.
Speaker 0: So, I mean, I I would love a hundred thousand months. Hundred thousand dollar months would be amazing. And we've been steadily growing. You know, there's there were I would say, honestly, like, COVID is really wet. Boosted our revenue.
Speaker 1: Definitely.
Speaker 0: It was it was it's not a great thing to go through, but it was a great thing business wise in this industry as you know. So it and it continues to grow. So, yeah, a hundred thousand dollar months are are my goal and anything above that is, you know, icing.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It's a great call. Great. Cool. So we wanna go from forty to sixty k to hundred k a month. Yes. The only thing stopping from getting there is just signing more clients. And the only thing stopping from signing more clients is just speaking to enough qualified people that are, you know, willing to pay you on a month of, you know, yearly basis, annual contracts and then should be pretty straightforward.
Speaker 0: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So on that, obviously, we need to get you speaking to the right people on a daily basis. Mhmm. What are those people? Who's the ideal client?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Great question. So these are typically gonna be corporate clients that It's a variety, honestly. So I'll give you some examples of clients. So we had we just finished our routine because they got bought out by a bunch of investors. But they were with us for five years. They were a an international hair product. And we did their social media marketing as well as Google Ads and their social media ads on Facebook and Instagram.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: So We also did, like, some YouTube video production stuff, and they were they were around between eight to ten grand a month was their retainer. So that's that's a client, physical products, e commerce, products. And then I also have a couple clients that are business consulting firms --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- that within their firm, they have business coaches, online business coaches, and they have courses and masterminds and things like that. They have an internal sales team, and our job is to help them with their visibility, with their content marketing, so visibility on social media, including LinkedIn too, as well as, you know, video repurposing, blogging, Facebook and Instagram ads, lead generation through those avenues. So that's another type of client. We also have worked with mortgage companies that are looking for lead generation. So it's it's a variety I don't know if that helps, like, kinda pinned down. My favorite type of client to work with are the the business consultants. Mhmm. So high level business consultants that have teams that they the the business consultant themselves or business coach has a big organization. They are authors. They speak at conferences all over the world. They are looking for somebody or a company to handle their visibility and lead lead generation into their programs. That's my favorite type of clients to work with. But again, we also work with e commerce -- Yep. -- brands. So, yeah, does that help?
Speaker 1: It helps very much. So it can be e commerce. The ideal would be high level business consultants. Not the individuals, not the, you know, self employed, more the high level ones with teams potentially with an established brand online, authors, speakers, you know, people with that establishment. And you also have mortgage in terms of lead generation, but the high level business consultants, that would be a number one.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. And And to expand on that a little bit, those high level business consultants that don't have a team are the ones that come into my mastermind.
Speaker 1: So you do have a down
Speaker 0: Because they right.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: So I have clients that have started in my mastermind and then figured out that, you know what, Gina? I actually need you guys to do everything for me, and they go up into the agency. And then I have and then I have clients. They come in thinking that they have the resources to hire us as their agency and then realize, okay. No. I don't have the resources, but I still wanna work with you. Bring me into your mastermind. And maybe they have a virtual assistant. Right? And I do allow one virtual assistant to come in with that. But it's more of a done with you. Mastermind, it's not done for you, like the agents. So there could be a lot of crossover.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. So you have a whole ecosystem around this. But even if someone can't qualify for the agency specifically, they can go to I'm with you master mine.
Speaker 0: Yep.
Speaker 1: That is perfect. Alright. So we have a clear idea of where you are. We wanna go forty to sixty k to around a hundred k per month. Based on most clients, that's very reasonable. And if we can just get you in contact with more high level business consultants with teams, the brand, all those speakers. I mean, you'll never be able to sell them. And even if you don't, sell them on the agency, you can sell them on the mastermind, which will be perfect. Mhmm. So right now, just in terms of your sales process, let's say you were to be able to generate leads consistently and bookings consistently, would you be taking a pause or would a sales rep or someone else be taking them?
Speaker 0: So right now, it would be me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Which my, you know, my meeting times are Some weeks are not easy, other weeks are more open. So but, yes, right now it's me.
Speaker 1: Perfect.
Speaker 0: And and I and I have and right now, I plan for the actual call to be me. That's part that's something that I have to work through with, like, letting go of some of that control. Now getting them to the call can be somebody else.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: One hundred percent. But the actual call would be with me. Now there are, like, you know, to get them to the call, there's we do qualify them. Right? So sometimes I don't even like, I don't even we don't even offer the call. If we feel that they're just not the right fit, we'll send them to a resource or, you know, send them to somebody else that I know that might be a better fit for them. So I I would like obviously a lot of prequalifying before it gets to the point to get on a call with me.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent, like, your time is very valuable. Right. You can't be having get on every call. Alright. Perfect. And just so we can get some context as to what you've tried in the past? How are you currently impacting clients besides referrals, obviously?
Speaker 0: So I would have to say from networking. So I I do a lot of networking I host networking virtual events with higher level of people. Also, I am in my in my like for myself, I am in two really high level masterminds myself with business coaches. And inside of those programs, I get referred well, so it's the same thing, referrals. Just connecting with people that are, you know, at my same level. And I'm very visible online also, so I will get somebody that will see, like, one of my lives streams and then -- Mhmm. -- you know, say, hey, I know somebody who needs help, but again, that's a referral. So it's a lot it's word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals. Typically. When people come into my mastermind, that's usually they'll come in because I do run ads for myself, but it's it's to get somebody to, like, a workshop. And then from there, we get on a call. Right? We we are or we have started to plan out to run Google ads for the agency. Like, within the next month or so. That's something that I had never I've never done because we just always got referrals. But I am I'm in I'm I'm ready to honestly sub up into this next level of hundred k months. So so that's something that we wanna try. But yeah, it's just mainly referrals and word-of-mouth for the agency.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That is very good in the sense that you know, if you're growing from word-of-mouth, it's just it's always good because it's just a great indicator that people like what you do. They're referring to other people. And the fact I have a brand already online doing these live streams, not to get ahead of myself, but this is when you do start some sort of outbound or some sort of advertising. What we found is that the clients who have the brand, the content, these assets online, they get significantly better results when they do outbound with us via email, LinkedIn, Facebook, adds whatever it might be because it just adds that additional level of we call it external factors, but in the actual so you had a big advantage there. What I do wanna ask is, in terms of referrals, in terms of what amount, how predictable is the actual acquisition. How consistent of the clients are coming?
Speaker 0: It's not super consistent because Well, it's well, I would for a few different factors, I would say number one because my focus, you know, sometimes when we are, like, at capacity, for example, then I shift my focus to marketing more of my mastermind. Because that's where really my passion is is to be in there helping these entrepreneurs in a small group setting. And I've been comfortable I've just been comfortable with where we're at. But, like, this week, I had a I had a I have three people that reach out to me out of I say it's not out of the blue. It seems like it's out of the blue, but I know it's not. It's the things that I I do on a consistent basis by showing up that gets people to remember and then, you know, they start talking and from seeing my emails go out, things like that. But it's not like, I haven't we haven't set a process where I'm we're we're literally, like, contacting ten companies a week. And then from that, we know that we're gonna get this money sales calls and then from that, we're gonna get this many calls. For the agency, it hasn't worked that way. It works that way with my masterminds. I know if I wanna bring people in there, I have, like, leads. I've got tons of leads that I that I reach out to you on a weekly basis to have conversations with them to then get them in there. Before the agency, it just hasn't been that way because it's just referrals and then, you know, we we do well. So I've kind of been complacent about it --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- for a bit, but I know that there's a lot of room for growth.
Speaker 1: Definitely. I mean, then based on that question, when are you actually looking to start moving towards a hundred k a month?
Speaker 0: I would say, like, June, like, literally, like, start getting things whatever processes need to be built out -- Yeah. -- like now, you know, with this month, and then we could as of June, start really focusing on that.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. Because, I mean, honestly, you're doing pretty well and most people stand it. So The question always need to ask is actually when you're looking to do it or if you're looking to do it. Because if not
Speaker 0: Yes. Right. Yeah. I mean, yes. That is absolutely a goal. So how how does this work with what you guys offer?
Speaker 1: Sure. So, I mean, just to recap everything. It seems like like I was saying at the beginning, the biggest problem that you're facing is just you know, not having a predictable way of getting in front of your ideal prospects every single day.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: I think that can solve so many problems for you. In the sense that if you have this consistent inflow, you know how many people it takes to get on to a call that are converted to a client that would result in this revenue. You know, you can make the key hires, get salespeople on potentially, hire more people in the back end and then fully remove yourself from the actual agency. This is what we do with a lot of our clients. Now they're very involved in everything because they don't have that predictability. And once we have it, once they can step out of sales, step out of acquisition. They can focus on doing what they, you know, actually want to do. So if this is the case and you're like, obviously, ninety nine percent of our clients have seen great results So do you mind if I share just a little bit more information about what we do?
Speaker 0: Go ahead. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. So, yeah, based on what you told me, like I said, you seem like a great fit. And Again, to give a quick overview, we help establish marketing agencies to increase revenue by around fifty thousand to one hundred thousand per month within six to nine months. And just to reiterate, the absolute biggest problem that we hope to solve is client acquisition. So, again, the agencies we work with, they have the systems. Right? They have the foundation. They have the understanding how to deliver. In your case, you have clients that stay on for four to five years. You've grown from referrals. You know, it's perfect. You have everything there. You have the brand. You have the content. Right? You just don't have the time to actually reach out to these people every single day because you're running a mask line and an agency. So I mean, based on that, that's the biggest problem we're helping to solve. Right? Getting in front of your ideal prospects every single day, So this would be high level business consultants with teams. And I mean, if that's the case, scale will be pretty much inevitable. I don't wanna call it easy. So I do think it will be easy, but people I should stop saying it's easy. But based on that, I'd love to share a bit more. Would you be able to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal for you on how I think we can help you reach hundred k month?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Totally.
Speaker 1: Sounds good. Alright. I'll just bring up my calendar, and we can see it. Okay. Will this time tomorrow with you?
Speaker 0: Tomorrow, I don't think so, but let me open let me open it up. Like, I'm somewhere tomorrow at one. So tell me a little bit about you really quick. How long have you been doing this?
Speaker 1: Good question. People don't usually ask that.
Speaker 0: Really?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Not a not a common thing to ask. And if those times don't work, just let me know when I can send
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: But about me, like, a long time at this point, So our business currently is run by myself, and then I have a partner, desire. Right? He is the head of growth I'm the CEO of the company managing the entire team. We have about twelve people on board right now. Mhmm. And ninety percent of them are client focused who's helping to deliver results in terms of booking meetings, building the offer, making case study videos, helping with sales, things like that. I'll see going to a lot more detail on this tomorrow or whenever you can book India.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Those are entire process, but Yep. That's how about you?
Speaker 0: Okay.
Speaker 1: Give me a minute.
Speaker 0: So I asked actually and the other thing I was gonna ask you before I get inside. So where are you out of? Where are you located?
Speaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now. Partners in UK. Uh-huh. Yeah. And you?
Speaker 0: Okay. I'm in South Florida in the US.
Speaker 1: South Florida.
Speaker 0: Close to Miami.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: That's like the bigger city around me. Okay. So tomorrow, you know what? I actually am open tomorrow one. I don't know why. I thought I had to renew my calendar for tomorrow. So I guess they don't. That's the eleventh. Right? Yeah. I'm I'm open.
Speaker 1: So we
Speaker 0: can definitely meet tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So just to give some context, straight off this call, I'll schedule you in. And between them, either myself or someone else and the team will reach out to you just to confirm everything, make sure everything's okay. And then -- Uh-huh.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: in the actual call, what I'll do is I'll start by going through a ton of case studies, have agencies exactly like yours, lot of results, and then our exact process so you could pretty much do it with with others. And then all the initial details like how it works, pricing, things like that. And then we can go from there. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. That works. Yeah. No worries. How long is this meeting, like, an hour, thirty minutes?
Speaker 1: Around forty five minutes.
Speaker 0: Okay. Alright. Yeah. That works. That's fine. Alright. Cool.
Speaker 1: Great. Gina was an absolute pleasure speaking to you. I'll send the invite, and then talk to Mark, looking forward to it.
Speaker 0: Okay. Sounds good. Thank you.
Speaker 1: Alright. See you.
