Speaker 0:  Hi, Ethan.
Speaker 1: Hey. How are you?
Speaker 0: I'm very well. How are you?
Speaker 1: Doing excellent. The week's been great. I wanna make sure is Cerimás, the correct pronounce Yes.
Speaker 0: Cerimás. Yes. That's correct.
Speaker 1: Very nice, man. Otherwise, has everything been?
Speaker 0: I'm busy too. We have a bit of a, how do you call it, a lot of long holidays -- Mhmm. -- in the past few weeks. So it's been kind of quiet and then it peaks up again and it's quiet again. It's so nice kind of everybody's coming back to work in thinking with q which queue are we in q two? Going into the next queue, Yeah. So we kind of we just opened an office in Singapore as well. So we kind of prepping the marketing and attraction plan side of things.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So busy. Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I was really looking forward to the call. I really wanted to see how it potentially help you out. So if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you'd like.
Speaker 0: Yes, please take it away. I I'm sorry it's been It's in a few emails, but between each one, it takes a long time because everything went to spam, so I didn't really see them. And then it kinda, like, went check my spam, like, once a week and then kind of saw the email. And I'm, like Yeah. Right? There's a lot of emails coming from agents a growth partner. It's kind of I'm just wondering what is your basically, how how can you have this role?
Speaker 1: Absolutely. We are persistent. So how these goals go is I just wanna start off by asking quick questions, help me understand where you are. Where you wanna be, and if we could potentially help you get there. And then obviously, if we seem like a good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works, and everything else to that team.
Speaker 0: Oh, okay. Yes. Great. No. That makes sense. Yeah. So we are pendulum. So pendulum consulting or we are pendulum. Is basically an e commerce growth agency. So we looking at work with clients who have who owns a DTC brand. Or they have a retail offline store, and they have an e commerce side of things. So we started off working with clients who have predominantly in a retail space, very big brands in Thailand, and they have websites that they need to grow from zero point five percent of total revenue from e commerce to ten percent thirty percent, you know. So we kind of work based on work with those clients first. And then we have a business partner. We're working on those six brands in Thailand, And then we kind of see, like, oh, this is might be something, five business is missing. So we kind of left that side of clients' consultancy and then just kind of side of an agency together. And we're working with D2C brands, still working with D2C brands and some in retail sector, beauty sector to help them grow their e commerce revenue through paid media, email marketing, social media marketing, content marketing, everything.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic.
Speaker 0: And Yeah. So towards the end of last year, we decided Singapore is the next one because we have a lot of clients. We got a few leads, strong leads coming in from Europe, wants to open the market or online. Expand to Asia as well as some Thai brands that want to go to Singapore. So we just registered a company in Singapore and now we kind of reaching out to a lot of people that we know to get to meet people and as well as reaching out to companies like, you know, yourself, to see how we could speed this process up a little bit.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Because it's we only a small team We don't have a business development person because we haven't had the need to have one. But for Singapore, the fact that it's a new market is very highly competitive. Clients are aware of what is e commerce, what it takes in e commerce. We feel like we need somebody to help us. Be that qualification bit and try to bring in meetings for us to to, you know, turn into proposals and court seals.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. Cool. So just so I know I heard everything correctly, you guys are a e commerce growth agency helping obviously e commerce brands. Mhmm. You see, once that are in retail now, they want to expand e commerce as well, majority in the big space. Guys are providing paid media, email, content, social, or with the, you know, with the goal of increasing revenue for
Speaker 0: your clients?
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. And you just open up offices in Singapore and you want to expand there. That's a major goal right now.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yes. As our q two, q three target.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. Alright. Cool. So just so that we can put a clear metric on the goal. Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna be?
Speaker 0: This is a tricky question even because we are trying to grow here as well. But we couldn't find talent to join the team that would that we see that this is the caliber that we are comfortable handing over a lot of clients work too. It's been a struggle ever since I worked in Thailand, actually. I've been --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- I mean, I've been worked I started my career in in in London and then I went to Singapore and in Hong Kong and then I came to Thailand about nine years ago. To start working with Thailand, Thai clients and Thai colleagues. I find it very, very difficult to find a good digital marketer -- Mhmm. -- to work with me in delivering me delivering the the same performance and the same service level that I require. Because I think I'm not sure if you're aware Thailand is a bit behind in terms of so digital capability compared to London or compared to Singapore. We're maybe ten years behind Singapore and twenty years behind London, I would say. So in terms of talent, it's been very difficult to hire locally. So a lot of the I want to say I wanna grow you know, two, three million dollars revenue. But at the moment, I don't see that I can fulfill those target with the card resource. That we have and the struggle that we have hiring people. Singapore might be a different ballgame because people are more advance in terms of their knowledge, their capability, their more discipline, I would say -- Mhmm. -- and kind of they know how to deliver and take accountability and responsibility. So I feel like it might be different, but we haven't looked yet. So at the moment, by this is partner and I and the small team that we have, with the work that comes in, we will do it ourselves first, and then we will work with freelance and partners to deliver them, especially the technical side, and then we're looking to grow.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So the goal is to get to around two to three million per year, but the biggest limitation is finding the talent that can actually take over you guys.
Speaker 0: Exactly. Say it. So we just wanna be realistic. So target to target revenue for us for first twelve months at one million, which is about maybe eight hundred u eight hundred thousand USD is probably what we're aiming for.
Speaker 1: Eight hundred thousand USD.
Speaker 0: Yeah. It's just gonna do the quick calculation.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Around that.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So out of curiosity, what is the plan in the future to actually start finding the talent?
Speaker 0: Well, obviously, we would have to reach the at the moment, the service offerings for Singapore and Thailand. Mhmm. Like, this is Huddl and our small to see the team that we have right now can can deal with
Speaker 1: it. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And the way that we the the way that we structure our service offering is to make sure that we, as the management and the core team, can service the client and slowly rolling out to our partners who will be delivering the same the same capability as us, but we will be the client facing it. And then we can if we outsource them and then we come up with, okay, the cost is too high, better to hire in in house, then we didn't do. At the moment, we see that partnering with partners like LTV plus or Uplers seems to be a good fit for us. With the service that we're offering.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. So you'd partner with them that manage the delivery, but you still be client facing.
Speaker 0: Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. That's
Speaker 0: that's the plan. But obviously, that's based on service offering that we have right now. If that change, for example, clients want us to do, you know, e to e, e commerce, you know, help them launch the brand, run the brand, then it will be a different types of talents that we need.
Speaker 1: Definitely.
Speaker 0: Which might translate to a in a deep hire.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. That's perfect. So the goal is around eight hundred thousand revenue per year, so around sixty to seventy thousand per month. How far is it from you guys are right now?
Speaker 0: We just started.
Speaker 1: We just We
Speaker 0: just started. We just started. So we kind of we're not taking into account the Thai business because that's kind of just running it on its own. We just need to at the moment, while the plan is to close high business in in in in in altogether because we don't wanna pay for the tax that is so so high, both corporate tax and personal income tax. So we're trying to close that debt, and then we just wanna move to Singapore, my understanding. So we just launched -- Mhmm. -- Incorporated in Singapore in March.
Speaker 1: Wow.
Speaker 0: So our income is zero at the moment. Although we have one we have one clients who signing us on hopefully soon. He already gave us like a a written confirmation. It's just contract signing. And, hopefully, that kind of, you know, pick it up and and and if you just have to meet more people, The thing is we can do ads. We can do all those cold calling activities, but we kind of that hasn't been working for us for Thailand. So I don't know if it's gonna be working for Singapore. So I'm kind of at the moment looking at different ways to do business development.
Speaker 1: Definitely. And we're gonna think we'll definitely go into this. We can discuss potentially why it didn't work and what we recommend. And
Speaker 0: -- Mhmm. --
Speaker 1: that's great. So you just started out in Singapore and for the the Thailand one. The original books. How many clients are you guys working with there right now?
Speaker 0: At the moment, we have about One, two, three. About five clients. So we're taking care of their e to e into into any e commerce from building the website all the way to running. We run ads for some of them just ads, and some of them were doing email services.
Speaker 1: That's amazing.
Speaker 0: Set up run. So, yeah, it's the thing is the mistakes that we have for the past year that we run the business in Thailand. Mhmm. We are overestimating the ability of the clients to understand what we do deliver. They know e commerce. But for them, e commerce is having a website and selling it. It's for us, it's more than just that. It's more it's about merchandising. It's about stock management. It's about operation. It's about customer service and it's about tech. So it's everything combined. It's a new discipline on its own. Most high clients that we have, the head of e commerce. Or the person who's taking care of e commerce. Have a sales background? Or have a marketing background?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Or works have an IT background. Head of ITs. Now taking care of e commerce. So that's that's the struggle that we have for the past years. And they don't really understand what it takes to run, so they don't really see the way we see how e commerce should grow. For them would be, oh, you want the you want more sales? We launch promotion more sales. I'm like, yeah, that's no brainer, but you just you know, you butcher your margin and you destroy the relationship with first purchase. But, you know, you're making them, conditioning them to only expect sales. So it's kind of the way they look at it. It's very different than ours. So it's kind of when we start speaking to clients from Singapore talk talking to business owners Singapore, Malaysia. When I get it, so we kinda wanna move towards that market. Rather than stop here and just, you know, shouting out about our lungs that nobody understands.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So it's really about finding the people that under stand or even just showing them what's missed to actually run an e commerce business. Right? It's not just website and some ads. Ratio is customer service, merchandising, all these.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's it's it's it's been challenging for us to see to meet clients and speak clients that really understand what it takes. Singapore seems to be a different kettle of fish.
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 0: So but I have a lot of contacts that I work with in the past in Singapore. Context with software company or agencies or clients, potential clients. But I wanna fish out of that pond.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: A little bit more because as much as I love to go and, you know, ask them to, hey, I can see I kinda see potential from clients who might really need help fixing what's wrong with e commerce.
Speaker 1: Definitely. And I I love the way you think about it in terms of the business as a whole as opposed to just some ads. Even some of our clients now still look at it and go to just a website and some traffic in there.
Speaker 0: Yeah. You'll be surprised, like, oh, we have a shop in Shopee in Lazada, marketplace. And now like, yeah, that doesn't mean you run an e commerce though. It's you just you have follow you have to follow them. Like, you won't believe how many times in a month that these marketplaces run promotions -- Yeah. -- and you are conditioned to follow. Otherwise, you can't make sales. And that's just destroy your margin, plus the fee that you have to pay these marketplaces. You've lost twenty percent of the margin just because of that. And because they the people that run business, they run e commerce, they don't take care of the P and L. So they don't know that affected the one million that you get that day, you only make ten percent margin. In comparison to, you know, owning your own audience, looking at from a full funnel perspective, managing your operational well and have a strategy in place. Overall, margin from from online, from e commerce should be the highest one -- Yeah. -- in terms of all your revenue revenue channels. But it's yeah. So anyway, that was a struggle. So it kind of went off track a little bit.
Speaker 1: But you're so completely right. And just to get back to it. So we expand to Singapore. Currently, you're just starting out there, which is perfectly fine. Goals to get around sixty, seventy k per month, that's around eight hundred k per year. I guess the only thing stopping you from going from where you are now to the goal is just signing more clients because
Speaker 0: -- Exactly. --
Speaker 1: you clearly have a better understanding than ninety nine percent of people as to what actually it takes to run an e commerce business. You understand how to do it. Understand how to deliver. You have the team or you're looking for the team and you have the bot you just need to sign more clients. And in order to sign more clients, you just need to speak to more qualified prospects.
Speaker 0: Exactly. Exactly. So speak to more people and find the right offering that they would be like, this is what I need. You know, this is my pain point. Great. Let's let's talk. Let's find out more because every time when we have face to face with clients. We get some we get some message across -- Yeah. -- some way somehow. The reason why they don't work for us is because they see us. It's a little bit our price is a little bit more expensive because we not look at it just we do ads for you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Exactly.
Speaker 0: We we yeah. So a lot of high clients don't understand that because I'm competing with other agencies just for ads alone, competing with agencies that only charge five percent --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- agency fee. Even I cannot do that. And I know that what they did is just setting it up. Click a few buttons and launch it, but that's not how we work.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: So but the clients are looking at, oh, it's five versus fifteen. And I'm like, yeah. But the revenue that you generated from us is actually more if you think about. And I have a case that is that prove exactly that. Clients only move from fifteen percent with us. To ten percent with our competitor, and their revenue was gone by thirty thousand USD in first month. I It's I'm like, yeah, I don't have to I don't I don't wanna even go there, but but the the way we do that so we do emails, the way we do content and social. Is very different because we just we're not just for email, we did not just blast.
Speaker 1: You
Speaker 0: know, we do behavioral studies. We make sure that we send to the right for the right time with the right message. We care about your business. We care about your customer. That's the that's the whole reason why my business partner and I and our team exist because we understand that to make money, it's your customer that you should care about. Not yourself, not your sales, not your margin, it's them. So as soon as you share, you show that They'll know. They appreciate they'll come back without you offering them any promotion. So it's kind of that battle that we have with clients. Always. So they will see us at, oh, you're a little bit more you're too expensive than this person and that person. But then when I get to the fact that that the value that we give you is this. But they were like, yeah. But I only want that. Mhmm. I'm like, I I can't either I can't fight. It's just --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- it's very And it's how you it's it's very heartbreaking. You know, heartbreaking. It's so crushing. When clients go for your competitor, only because they're cheaper. And the worst thing is they won't even know the difference.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: You know, I went back to speak to my clients, the one that chose the other company. Mhmm. And they were and they were like, how how how is your boss respond react with this loss of a million a month because you use different way of the ads targeting. And they were like, they don't care because the off offline is making sales now.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And I'm like, oh my god. It's it's just is like shouting at a wall. So the more people we would like to speak to in the market that understand what it takes and what it's required. Oh, you know what? Maybe I'm just approaching offerings the wrong way this whole time. I never know. You know, so for this year with Singapore talk with Singapore market, my business partner and I'll be kind of streamlined the subs offering. Don't say to people, we are e commerce growth agency. We do everything from agency. That's what we do still.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: But we kind of break it down too. Let's for Singapore would be, let's fix your customer acquisition and customer retention problem. So you need custom you need to apply customer to make sales and you also have to keep them. These are the ways that we could help you. Are you facing these problems right now talk to us? That's kind of we kind of bring it down to the very, very basic that the business would understand. For Thailand, we just go, how are you sending emails today? Are you just blasting at people? Or are you just sending images, stack up, just one link in one email. Don't do that. So it's kind of we kind of have a have a assess what we've done wrong for the past year and kind of moving towards a new new direction.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Firstly, I just wanna say I love the approach that you take to business on focusing on the customer as a whole instead of what most people do just worry about themselves because you you taking the time and the energy to actually focus on everything else besides, you know, running amazing email campaigns, running amazing ads, you do that already. But all the other things that you focus on as well is one of the it just allows you to stand out because I speak to agency owners literally every single day. And by you saying these things, it genuinely shows that you're providing a ton more value than almost all the other agencies in the similar space. So I think if we can just create your messaging, create your offer in a way that presents all the value that you're already providing.
Speaker 0: Then I think he's gonna bring that message across yeah. Getting that message across from me has been a struggle because --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Both. This is fun and myself, both an introvert. And we're not a sound person. We're terrible at it. And it's like, It's like the worst combo. It's not a business. Right? None of us wants to be in front of people and then to say, hey, this is how great we are. Like, we're not bad at all. We kind of stick to like, we know this and we want to deliver this. And if we get in front of the client, people understand the value that we're trying to bring, and it's it's great, you know. But the rest majority of our clients would meet with agency that you've met, and they're just competing on price.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 0: In fact, be fancy words and fancy presentations. But we have to use twenty people, but I don't have a team. Do any people actually in meetings with you? But I can deliver the word of better of thirty people, you know.
Speaker 1: Exactly right. And we have applied extremely extremely similar to you, and I'll send more information about them potentially after this call. His name is Zach. He runs a company called Flax Labs. And again, complete end to end e commerce growth team. So it's not a challenge. Exactly. And even the metric that he goes for isn't even like revenue generated or OS. It's like it's monthly profit because it focuses on everything from operations to merchandising to fulfillment to everything. So I'll talk to you about more about him so that you can pretty much start implementing what he's doing. But just so we know, Obviously, we need to create an offer that allows you to actually present your value. We need to speak to more people on this space. Who actually is your ideal client?
Speaker 0: So our ICP's brands well, at the moment, brands in Singapore --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- that is in vertical of retail fashion because we have strong background on retail fashion, beauty, health, and wellness. Home and living. So those space of of clients that we work with in the past. We're targeting, hopefully, well, I don't know. It's it's how difficult it is, but in Thailand, it's been extremely difficult decision makers in the company. So head of e commerce direct e commerce director CEO, CFO, whoever who make decisions. They have to be the brand that willing to grow. We were having, like, the revenue target of those brands as in we would like to work with the brands that makes, you know, five hundred thousand say, per year or something like that in there. But I'm not sure if that's relevant because we are willing to take a brand that doesn't make any money right now to the revenue board that they want if they have the willingness to invest. They have to understand that it to grow busting fuzz, you need to fix whatever is broken. Tech technologically. Technically, in a in a either your website or your funnel or your email campaigns, the technical side of things if it's not working, like, your website load very slow. It's fake version, you know. So -- Yeah. -- they have to understand that there's an audit And there's a first round of fixes set up and foundation that they have to go through with us. And then depends on how big how big job it is. After that, then we'll actually implement the growth services.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's perfect. This is almost exactly what we're doing for a couple of other e commerce agencies now. So talking decision makers, CEO, head of marketing, direct of marketing, e commerce center of fashion, beauty brands, health and wellness, Right? Ideally, making over a five hundred k a year. That's perfectly fine. Will it grow? And you also will it take on brands who may not necessarily have all the money right now, but who are willing to invest in growing the business.
Speaker 0: Yes. Is that mindset that we're looking for? Or because if they don't have a budget right now, doesn't mean that we can enter with a basic level or, like, a trial level of service --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- fix a lowest hanging fruit for them and they can't take them forward once they can justify the investment with us. So because we that's how we approach a lot of brands from Thailand before because there were how you saw it, Vincent. Like, no, let's let's try with this one because we saw your program. You have a problem with let's say, onboarding and customer acquisition. Let's fix that through conversion rate optimization and proper welcome series. Yeah. And then it's a smaller investment for them and then kind of leads to something that is a bigger bigger fix or bigger implementation along in the for the future.
Speaker 1: That's a fantastic approach. So you can get them in at a lower investment one of the lower hanging fruits, you know, sort of fundamentals, welcome flows, make sure the page loads at a certain speed.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Get
Speaker 1: them resolved.
Speaker 0: If they have the needs to grow, if they have that that that requirement to grow -- Yeah. And willing to just try with the first entry level offer.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Great. Let's all together. Ideally, we would like them to be on either Magento or Shopify or Go commerce platform.
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 0: If, you know, we we because those are the tech oh, we can work with e commerce, we can work with side cores, ifinity, all those things. But These three are the platforms that we've had a lot of experience in and the tech stack that is around them.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. Alright. Cool. So just to recap, before I go through the last things that I wanna ask, Right? Just so that we know we're both on the same page. Right now, you're looking to expand to Singapore. You're just starting out there. The goal is to get around eight hundred thousand dollars per year revenue that's around sixty to seventy thousand per month. The only thing stopping you from getting there is just signing more clients And the only thing we've got to
Speaker 0: do for
Speaker 1: learning more clients is speaking to enough qualified prospects, which is decision making, retail, beauty, fashion, meet the wellness brands on a daily basis. And if you can do that consistently, I have no doubt in my mind that you'll be able to sign clients just based on the amount of value that you're providing. So if we get you in contact with them, all the way that you can present your value, in a way that's clear, easy to understand, and that the client or the prospect actually understands it. If you can do them consistently every single day, scaling to sixty to seventy k per month will be pretty straight. Would that be good to be close to your situation?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. That sums up perfectly.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. So the last thing that I just wanna figure out before I share, you know, what I recommend is you just walk me through what you what you guys have tried in the past to actually, you know, book meetings, sign clients?
Speaker 0: We try come we've tried well, most of the ones that we've tried, we were. We run ads on LinkedIn -- Mhmm. -- and Google. And we've done a campaign. They're still using the ads, but we've launched an ebook for call four seps. To e commerce success. Right? It got a lot of interest, but it doesn't generate any sales leads. I think it's because it was we were targeting Time Market, but the content was an English.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: So that's a mismatch that we kind of foresee. We foresee it, but we did not feel like we should tackle it because we feel like if we wanna work with somebody in Thailand. They should be able to speak English. Mhmm. Because, you know, it's it's just it's not discrimination. It's just it's just that my my business partner is is is British -- Yeah. -- and and because And, honestly, I'm more comfortable speaking in English than in Thai anyway. So if a client will come to us, don't understand a word of English. Yep. And want us to implement, you know, a whole program for them based on our e book.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: I'm stuck doing a loan at the moment. So at the time at the time. So we didn't go for it. I thought even on that, we share it through the digital group within Thailand, and it got a lot of tractions and engagement. A lot of shares -- Yeah. -- but no actual potential business. Coming out of it. We also did a partnership with the United Overseas Bank, which is a bank in Singapore. To do a Fin Lab, which is they incubate a few SMEs. Tools, digital transformation.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: We also done we have a contact a a time company that do a business development for us, but I don't think they were doing it in the way they didn't they didn't identify ICP. They're basically like, we're gonna target whoever we can for you.
Speaker 1: Really?
Speaker 0: Then try to book yeah. They basically charged me an x amount to book me up to five meetings a month. But those meetings that those meetings are good brands. Don't get me wrong. They're good brands. But they're not doing e commerce. Again, it's come back like, that they lack understanding of what we do. Mhmm. So they think, oh, a kind that wants social media marketing is e commerce. I'm like, no. That's not e commerce. All the clients that is looking to create an influencer campaign is for us. I'm like, no, that's not for us. Although they have good brands. They're like Bacardi, they're settler, big brands in Thailand as well, but it's not the right product thing. And that's the that's the thing because they think that we are social media and influence the cap agency instead of e commerce is what we do. Even though in my brief sheet. I specifically said that it's an e commerce. Yes. So those are the things that we've tried before. And referral. So we reach out to people that we know who knows people, who knows people, and then those way seems to bring us more business because we get to speak to them. We get to speak to the decision maker because we know a friend of the decision maker or we know somebody in that company or we know somebody in that company. So it's kind of that's the way we manage to get clients Oh, and we were also listed on sort list. It's like a directory --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- for agency. That kind of that worked, bring us a few good leads. So this is a directory. I'm sure you'll know of it's from Belgium. Yeah. And they've been very well known in Europe, I think. We listed ourselves a year ago and we got about t something leads coming out of it. We get it says with two business coming out of it. So it's it's pretty good that too. But majority of the leads that come from sort list, the ones that we didn't close, other ones that we couldn't get in touch with them.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Like, they provide email, they provide phone number, but I call and I email nobody replied. So as long as we can get in front of people -- Yeah. -- we have no we have we have no doubt we are confident that we could get in some. We can share our proposal for people that we've met in their happy interest.
Speaker 1: I agree differently. So you tried LinkedIn and Google ads, cold calling, the ebook the ebook got attention. It got people to click, it got, you know, interest, but it didn't convert into any sort of sales, then part of this. The entire company doing business development, but they're not reaching out to the right people, and then obviously referrals and sort list. Out of -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: all of these besides referrals and sort list, which was the best performing for you guys?
Speaker 0: None of them.
Speaker 1: None of them.
Speaker 0: None of them. Because it wasn't I think it was our approach as well, Ethan. I cannot discredit the platform. Like, all the people who does believe from me. Mhmm. But I think it's just we were lacking we didn't define with them our ICP. We did not we just tell them we want big brands. You know, we want to talk to as many people as we can. We want big brands and we want e commerce or digital. So that's very that very broad relief for them. Can't blame them as well as the creds or the ads that we run were not in a local language --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- as well. So it's not a platform that is not and we are We use a very sophisticated language in comparison to a Thai agency, let's say, run ads. Do SEO. If it's not work, will give you money back. Like, we don't do that kind of ads. Yeah. You know, so I cannot discredit the platform. It's just the app approach maybe not fit for the market. Mhmm. So this year, we scrap all those, learn from our mistakes. And basically starts start start again with a new approach, new partners, you know, new ways. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's such a self aware thing to say that it's not the platform's fault. It's just the approach that you took. So many people, if they don't see success, they're like, Yeah. Cold calling definitely doesn't work. You know?
Speaker 0: Oh, I I I see it's working, but it's like, Okay. You could get irritated, but it's I think if you do it the right way, you could get to through to people and it
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 0: I think it's just me. Approach is the approach really. It's it's just that it it's an art form in itself and and it takes a lot of courage for me personally, it takes a lot of courage to do to do that, you know. And I I can't do it. I had a conversation with my business partner because we were going through all these traction plans. How are we gonna reach out to people? So we were signing up for business directory for companies contact in Singapore. We also paid for similar web and built with form to, you know, extract out the company information and the platform and the technology that we use to prepare us into speaking that prospects.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And then I'm saying to him, look, I'm gonna tell you right now. I'm not doing this. Okay. He's like, why? He's like, I'm like, I I I ban it for Thailand. It was it was saw crushing because I'm an introvert --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- getting the courage out to call stranger and try to I don't know. It's like, I don't wanna sound condescending. It's condescending over the phone to them.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Like, because my message to them basically say, I know you need us because you can't do it the way we can. We've done it before. We have proven success. You work with us. That's my main message. But I can't say that to them. You're right. Because most of them don't even know what they're doing. Like, I have, like, head off and I'm quote unquote, head of e commerce. For one of the big conglomerate that, like, that sell la carte and selling all these, like, big brands.
Speaker 1: Nice.
Speaker 0: Positive heading up e commerce It's a merchandising.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: I'm like, no. And so when I speak to the, she doesn't understand what is e commerce because her e commerce is oh, I select products to go on the website. That's e commerce for me.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And another company who also owns Jimmy Shu in Thailand, for example, distributor. The head of e commerce, quote unquote, is operation. So she deals with logistic, company only. And for her, that is e commerce.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: I can speak to them in their e commerce language.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: But I cannot sell our service to them because they don't understand the whole thing. You know? That's a
Speaker 1: good point. Yeah. Because yeah. Then it it could be the case and tell me if the sounds right to me, but it could be the case that all the platforms that work cold calling, Google Ads, email, we just didn't have the right offer the right messaging. Actually comes back to all the value that you have, that
Speaker 0: you prefer. Exactly.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 0: Exactly. And we kind of blocking ourselves because we don't wanna feel We don't wanna sound too cocky. Yeah. The thing is we can't know. Like, if we want to, we can't because we have twenty years of experience. I've I've done e commerce since there's no e commerce in time. I've done email since there's no emails marketing in time, and I've done automation. When Thai people are still blasting email,
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: You know, it's I've done all of that, and I've created the revenues, generated revenues, and own P and L of brands and as of you know, companies before I've done it. I've take the revenue from zero point five percent --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- of total. To five percent and going towards ten percent in two years. Like, I've done it, man. But Nobody gets it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: So we don't wanna be cocky because that's not who we are. But we are we kind of brutally honest to people and how you don't like it.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Like they don't like it when you tell when you do tell them your shit.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: It's like, no. But I can take it Singapore and they do it. You should keep doing this. It's alright. Why are you throwing it this way? I've been all that. I've been through it. I'm fine with it, but it's not the way you do it here.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: So we struggle because the the cultural fit, I would say. Mhmm. I run it because I'm a time. And I've been working in Ireland for a long time, but it's it's just not the way. Yes. So, again, it's we need help with business development for Singapore. And in the future, when we're going to Europe, basically.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent And
Speaker 0: we don't wanna hire we sometime we don't wanna hire in house even it's just because we wanna be able to put a break when we want to and don't want to have to bear that cause because we know our capacity.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And we work with, let's say, external agency who help us grow with business development. We can tell you this month's pause --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- we can't even more, you know, stop. And and there's a way that we could allocate that portion of budget elsewhere. If we hire an in house business development, we have to pay thing, salary forever, actually, quits, you know? And I don't know if that makes sense. I don't think you make sense. So I'm kind of telling my business partner that I'm looking for alternative now. And he's but he was, like, not sure because he wants to make sure that the clients speak to us --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- because we are the ones that close it. I'm like, it's okay, but the initial bit. The leg work, the running, the calling, the hi. This is Eric calling from it. No. We don't have to do that. I'm changing his spot a little bit, but he's not getting it yet, but but that way.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: What's that?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Very smart approach. And I mean, just to recap everything. I mean, you clearly, clearly have the experience. You clearly have the expertise. Like, twenty years, the results that you have, it's amazing. So we wanna go from pretty much starting out in Singapore to sixty to ten months. And it genuinely seems like the biggest problem you're facing is just acquisition. Right? It's just consistently speaking to qualified prospects who can afford what you're offering that are willing to grow, that have the mindset of growing. And then just putting the right message in front of these people so that you can convert them into clients
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Yeah. -- with the problems. And if that's the case, you're like ninety nine percent of our clients who've seen great results. Do you mind if I share what the next steps would be?
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Amazing. So based on what you told me, like I was saying throughout the call, you'd genuinely seem like a great fit. Right? You are. Clearly amazing at what you do. And to give a quick overview of what we do is that we partner with established marketing agencies you know, ninety five percent of them are in e commerce e commerce growth agencies to increase their revenue by fifty hundred k a month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve across every niche is client acquisition. Right? They start signing enough clients systematically predictably. And the reason is because, one, they may not have the right message to put in front of these people. They're being seen as a a commodity. They're getting, you know, questioned about price. They're being compared to ten thousand agencies. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: They don't
Speaker 1: have the right message. Or they're not speaking to enough people. Right? They're not getting this message in front of the right prospects on a daily basis so that they can make the sales. Or commit. So
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Yeah. -- based on this, like I said, I definitely think you're a great fit. Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal on exactly how that we can help you reach an extra sixty, seventy k a month based on what you told me to do.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Where are you based, Ethan?
Speaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now.
Speaker 0: Cape Town. Okay. So what what time is it for you?
Speaker 1: Three fifteen for me. Our call started at two thirty PM. We could do an hour earlier.
Speaker 0: No. No. No. I'm just kind of wondering, like, that the hours different how do we do it tomorrow? Tomorrow? Oh, yeah. If tomorrow, you can do Actually, tomorrow, same time is fine or a bit earlier would be good too.
Speaker 1: That would be perfect. Where are you based right now?
Speaker 0: Bangkok.
Speaker 1: Bangkok.
Speaker 0: Oh, it's eight It's about it's eight fifteen PM for me.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. So we could do tomorrow at the same time, but an hour earlier. Would that work for you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So that would be six thirty for me.
Speaker 1: That's fantastic. Okay. Cool. So what I'll do is I'll send the invite straight off this call. And we can just confirm if that time is okay for you or don't you, you know, staying up way past your bedtime.
Speaker 0: But No. It's my kids who keeps coming in, and I could make me do the math problems. And I'm like, do we see me talking to a person right now? But I can't say no. And when's it gonna go in hiring mode? Yeah. But, yes, eight thirty oh, sorry. Six thirty for me would be great. Yeah. I'm guessing tomorrow you'll be preparing, like, the the fees and everything. Right? I mean, it's just okay. There's some context
Speaker 1: between now and then. Either myself or someone else and the team will reach out just confirm everything, make sure that time's okay. And on the call tomorrow, I'll be firstly going through a ton of case studies of e commerce agents, yours, and the one I mentioned earlier, Flex as well, the one that's
Speaker 0: yours. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Thank you. And And then I'll be going through our entire process, what I'd recommend for you, so you could genuinely do it with or without us. And then all the details like pricing, how it works, things like that. There again?
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's fine. I'm just one question. Do you where are your clients based? Are they based in America or are they based in Europe? Like, which which region?
Speaker 1: Great for
Speaker 0: Because I'm asking because we're also looking to spend to the UK in Q4.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: So it depends on how how fast things go. That might be another thing you could help us with as well.
Speaker 1: Of course. We so to give some context, we have clients everywhere. Right? So
Speaker 0: Yes. Okay.
Speaker 1: Margin is in US, UK. We have a couple in Canada. We have one in Mexico. We have one in Philippines as well. And then some countries like Netherlands, Germany. And they're everywhere. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. But it's a problem because you're working with agencies. Right? I'm just asking us out of curiosity. Will that be like a conflict of interest or like a like because you work with --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- basically, my competitor. How does that work? How does that, you know, what's where is there a line that you draw? Or, like, what? How does that?
Speaker 1: That's a great question. And The first line that we draw is if it becomes a case where there's potential conflict We just wanna take the effect in the first place. But
Speaker 0: -- Oh, okay. --
Speaker 1: it hasn't happened so far. And the reason it is firstly, because e commerce is just a huge space. There are millions of businesses. So the way we go for our talking is very specific. Right? So another company you mentioned earlier, they just went for, like, anyone, any brand, any business that
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Even be close to, you know, useful. The way we go is very niche specific. So for example, if you have case studies in fashion, but more specifically, you know, swimwear. Right? So that's many levels deep ups. We will prioritize talking you know, companies, brands that only meet the criteria that you really want. So if you Yeah. So for example, one of our campaigns for our clients is like I think it was like, what was it? Yeah. Like, coffee brands in Netherlands, making between five hundred k to one point five million.
Speaker 0: Very, very specific Okay. I got it. Okay. Again yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And each client just gets their own little segment as to where we're talking first. So
Speaker 0: we'll see.
Speaker 1: There's no Okay. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Okay. Right. Right. Okay. I'll look forward to the email and speak to you again tomorrow then. I won't keep you any longer. Sorry about the a lot of long winded conversation it tends to get to me. A lot to share.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. That is great. And would you want me to invite your partner to this call as well?
Speaker 0: No. It's it's it'll be too late for him. So the way he works, if it's if it's if the if everything sounds great, if the investment is is within our within our budget, obviously because we allocate for marketing and business development, then we will proceed. And because I take care of the business development, for both countries right now as in the activities itself. So I have a say in what we're gonna do. I just need to present the hey, say, speak to him through your process. He would have questions, but that could be done through email or another call with him once we are looking to onboard and We can do that later on. Yeah. Basically, that's it.
Speaker 1: Amazing. It sounds great. I'm really looking forward to it. Gonna be a great call, and I'll talk to you then. Thanks so much for speaking
Speaker 0: to Yes. Thank you so much for your time. We appreciate it,
Speaker 1: Ethan. Sir.
