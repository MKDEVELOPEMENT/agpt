Speaker 0:  Sounds like a good good fit. And at the end, you can decide if you wanna be a part of it or not. Is that okay? Just so I can find out where you want where you wanna be. And then you can decide it's gonna be pointless.
Speaker 1: Check. How are you doing, Ethan? You got me loud and clear. Yeah?
Speaker 2: Excellent. Excellent. How are you?
Speaker 1: Perfect. I'm very well. Thank you. How about yourself?
Speaker 2: Doing phenomenal. Just in case you wanna turn your video off, I normally have this audio only. You don't have to turn it off. Bye. Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: That's fine with me. It's fine with me.
Speaker 2: Okay. Cool. It just allows us to focus more on what's being said then. You know, some people haven't to worry about their hair and all of that stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Of course.
Speaker 2: Yeah, man. So
Speaker 1: yeah. So thank you for jumping on this call. I appreciate it's quite short notice. We only spoke on Friday. Mhmm. As I said on LinkedIn, it was very, very well timed because we've recently cut ties with our old VA. So essentially, what we were using it for. So my business model run a digital marketing agency that specializes in scaling e commerce brands through TikTok, so through organic TikTok. Yeah. So we put together, like, unique growth strategies. There's there's a whole heap of research that goes into it as you can understand for the niche of the product that we're working with But but, essentially, in short, the service that we offer is organic growth on TikTok. And obviously, in line with growing on TikTok, you're increasing brand awareness, and our main goal is to drive traffic to our client's website click through rights from from TikTok. Now we do offer email marketing or we can we can do pretty much everything about UX, email marketing. Design, but our high ticket offer is TikTok. So we wanna focus. I think your skill set around TikTok and finding more clients for that area of work. So I'm just interested to get a little bit of an understanding of how your business model looks and how it works because Like I said, we've taken a few LOs with our previous VAs because they were paying we were paying them monthly retainers They did get us a decent amount of leads. However, when we trawled through them and looked through them in higher detail, the generic account, it's hello emails. It's your info at it's just generic email addresses. So some of them were sending cold emails out for us some of them are just finding those emails and the whole service for shit, to be honest.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: So we're looking forward to getting someone on board that's gonna find high quality leads And I guess when it's just a hundred percent commission, it's in your best interest as well to get us high quality leads, isn't it? So I think it it will work very well.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Can't tell you how many times people have come on these calls and just told me horror stories about VAs. But, yeah, it got a sad. I just wanna ask you some questions just so I can see where you all really wanna be. And to see where I can actually help you, first of all, most importantly. Yeah. Then at the end, I'll explain our service, and you can decide if you wanna be a part of it or not. Is that okay with you? Yeah. Yeah. That's perfect. Cool. So you told me in the LinkedIn message that you had VAs in the past. Could you give a sort of metric on how well they actually did in their outreach?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I guess as a whole, I haven't got a sheet open, but he scraped about a thousand emails and from that, bro, I think we booked about three calls. But like I say, when we when we did a little digging into the metric, So because that was generic accounts. Mhmm.
Speaker 2: So
Speaker 1: we sort of we couldn't micromanage or we didn't we weren't onto it every day. We just thought, okay. We'll let this guy work in parallel with what outreach we're doing in the background. And then we when when we saw, okay, he's got a big list of a thousand leads here. We've booked three calls, why? And it's because there were generic email addresses. Now it's not our cold outreach. We're happy with our we've got a sequence of six emails. So myself and my cofound, we've had business mentors. We've perfected our cold outreach process. And when we send them to personalized emails that we've scraped from LinkedIn, we get like a forty five fifty percent open rate. We book calls. So we know that our our quality and our sequence isn't the issue. So to go back to your original question, answer your question, the metrics, I'd say, yeah, the only way to sort of describe what he delivered was, you know, three calls out of about a thousand emails so shocking.
Speaker 2: Yeah. That is impressively bad. But Yes. So you sell the TikTok. How much do you charge for this TikTok service?
Speaker 1: So the ballpark figures two thousand five hundred GBP for the package. Obviously, we we tweak it and tailor it to each client because Some people are already on TikTok. They understand the power. They just need to get that creative inspiration. You know, they don't have resource to put into the trend research and and identify what post for their niche. Some people wanna be completely hands off and they wanna send us the footage or they wanna shoot content themselves. We have to edit the footage and post it on the app. Ourselves. So we really do tailor it to to the client, but it starts at two thousand five hundred GBP. Okay. So what
Speaker 2: does your ideal client look like?
Speaker 1: So the ideal client is an an e commerce client that's already got a decent customer base established on another platform. So for example, Instagram. So we tend to when we do our own personal scrape and we tend to look at clients that have got above ten k on Instagram. But don't have a presence on TikTok. So it could be an aesthetically pleasing product you know, the world of e palm, you know, as you know, it could be anything. It could be a new innovative dog toy. It could be we've been working with some skin care brands, but the main thing that we look for is that loud vibrant packaging that we know is gonna be received when on TikTok. Because I don't know if you're on TikTok yourself, but in the first few seconds of the video, People have already decided whether they're gonna continue to watch the video or not, and you need to get a high amount of watch time on your videos in order to do well on the platform. So if you've got vibrant branding, it it just goes hand in hand with when we when we edit the videos and put hooks and call to actions on screen. So when we fund clients with really good branding. We yeah. We tend to handle those.
Speaker 2: That sounds good.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So I think I'm about there for you.
Speaker 2: So we can come back to it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's come back to it.
Speaker 2: I'll write that down. So what's your actual sales process from stranger to paying customer?
Speaker 1: So we've obviously got our sequence of six outreach emails. They never usually get past the third email. We get a response. We jump on a discovery call we talk to the client about well, we ask them why they're not used in TikTok. Most of them say because they think it's an app that primarily attracts children for trending dances and and funny videos. And then we obviously have to we have to sell the platform of TikTok first. So that's why there's there's a very in-depth sales process because as well as selling our services on TikTok. We do that, we have to sell the platform itself. Mhmm. So we go through the whole the sequence of pitching TikTok, saying there's a billion active monthly users. We do a little bit of research beforehand looking at what our potential clients demographic could be. So we work with the skin care brand, and we did a little bit of research on their target audience. So it was thirty year old women. So obviously, we did a little bit of TikTok to begin. What's the demographic of thirty year old women on the platform? It was like thirty nine percent and that works out for something like two hundred and eighteen million people a month active in in their demographic when you work out how many people are actually on the app. So we just have to sell the platform and we sell our services. And most clients haven't got the resource to actually during what we what we sell to them, which is great. They say that sounds great, but we haven't got the resource to do it, and then we say that's where we can come in. So it's almost like a friendly conversation. To our sales process. It's selling TikTok, telling them how they can use it and how they can capitalize on all of this new traffic. Telling them giving them suggestions. And then when they say that sounds great, we haven't got time. That's where we say, well, we've replicated this for our own e com stores. We've done it clients, we can help you do it as well. Mhmm.
Speaker 2: Cool. So do you know you're closing percentage?
Speaker 1: Yeah. I could get it I could get it up. Yeah. My cofounder, Sean's got a big Google Google Doc on me to track everything. The calls you booked, the closing rate. So, yeah, I'll dig that out for you.
Speaker 2: An estimate is also fine if you'd like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'd like I'd like to find out exactly for you though just to give you the accept
Speaker 0: that trick.
Speaker 1: It's not updated with the percentage. We've had fifteen calls, landed three clients.
Speaker 2: It's about thirty three percent?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Roughly.
Speaker 2: Cool. Thanks for that. So now, how are you currently getting customers besides the v VA that you canceled? Anything else, but so we can do that.
Speaker 1: Yeah. So I as well, I've been working alongside the VA. So I do cold outreach every day. So we we use LEMLIST. So myself and my co founder target hundred companies each a day. I scraped the emails using email funded software. We enrolled them into our automated outreach process through specialists, so through the sequence of six emails. So we're actively doing that each day. I'm active on LinkedIn as well, messaging other brand owners. So it's my co founder. So, yeah, we're we're both active daily.
Speaker 2: And are you doing, like, custom first lines, all of that?
Speaker 1: Custom first lines?
Speaker 2: Like personalized personalization for the emails?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. They're all personalized. Yeah. Tailored to the tell it to the receiver. Mhmm.
Speaker 2: Cool. So do you know how we've got a
Speaker 1: generic Lumina as well? Oh, really. Recorded a loom video. So it it's a generic high level one that could from a from a customer's perspective, it looks like it could just just to be just to them, but it's very high level just talking about, hey, became a commercial brand. It looks good for our TikTok growth strategy, blah blah blah. So yeah, there's a personalized new new video in the link to the email as well. Okay.
Speaker 2: Do you know how much it costs you to get a new customer? Or at least
Speaker 1: how much it costs? Well, I guess it's it's free to us because the the the clients that we've landed have all been from our own outreach, are they, I guess, they're free to us?
Speaker 2: Fair enough. Some people give time metrics as well, but fair enough.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So
Speaker 2: do you have a a system in place that's, you know, actually getting your customers on demand right now?
Speaker 1: Well, I guess that's what we we just wanna target more clients on mass. Obviously, we're focusing on client work now. So before And that's why I haven't been able to give you a time metric on how long it's taken us to get clients because we just hammer it every single day, and we used to we've been we've been doing this since. So I think November last year. So it hasn't taken us long. We've perfected the approach. We've landed three clients. And now we wanna focus on client work rather than outreach. So we'll probably just strip back the amount of time that we spend on outreach. So maybe find twenty ideal customers a day each still enroll them into our automated process and then spend the rest of the day smashing up the client work.
Speaker 2: Yeah. You must be quite busy doing client work and outreach.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a hectic month.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Have been there. So now I just wanna know where you are right now specifically. And where you want to be specifically. So the next question is, how much money are you currently making with this business right now? Mhmm.
Speaker 1: So it's we've got three clients on a two thousand GBP retainer. So in in six k, obviously, there's only myself and my co founder. So what's up? Our packages start at two thousand five hundred pound, but we're very fortunate that the three clients that we've landed, wanted to shoot content themself. So how our business model looks with these three clients is we essentially do the niche analysis, the trend research. So we dig down into the platform of TikTok for their niche, and then we write scripts for them. So we write scripts capitalizing on their target audience. They shoot the content. They send it to us. We'd store it in a Dropbox location. And then we optimize the content for TikTok, put in the the quarter actions, the text on screen, and just making it look native to the platform to to any TikTok users.
Speaker 2: That's cool.
Speaker 1: So they're they're all on the same package. Yeah. Two thousand GBP per month.
Speaker 2: I mean, twelve months time, where do you wanna be?
Speaker 1: We wanna be at ten k. We wanna scale it to ten k. And obviously, I think we could get there. But like I say, when with prioritizing client work, it just gonna take double the amount of time, isn't it? So so we're really eager to get someone on board doing some high quality outreach.
Speaker 0: It's what
Speaker 1: the end of the year we wanna be making at least ten k.
Speaker 2: You don't think if we got client acquisition down, marketing down, You don't think you'd be able to go further than ten k?
Speaker 1: For sure. Yeah. For sure. I'll write your optimism. Let's do it.
Speaker 2: I only have the optimism because I've seen it. But
Speaker 1: yeah. So it's all But some What's your background, Anita? Have you run a agency yourself before? And then you've just dig digressed into outreach? Or
Speaker 2: Exactly that. To a degree.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 2: Obviously, I would love to answer all of your questions near the end of the call because I just wanna get through these questions, but I want to listen right now. I sit on an advertising agency. And
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 2: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 2: I like the model. But and I found it extremely easy to get clients to get meetings booked. Yep. So I thought it would just be a lot more lucrative to help other agencies to do the same. Which is what I'm doing right now. Yeah. So okay. Yeah. I did also paid advertising, Facebook ads specifically. Mhmm. But
Speaker 1: Yeah. So if you're interested
Speaker 0: in the outage now Yeah.
Speaker 2: We can do one of this if you like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sounds good. We'll we'll do that at the end for sure. To go back to your question about why ten k so we're we're running other e commerce stores and drop shipping stores as well. So the agency, it's almost I guess, the agency is our side hustle because the e com stores take a bit of our time as well. So it's just about balancing workload and balancing what what's paying us, whereas if we review it yourself, we're not gonna turn clients down. We're not gonna turn what we've got a business model. We've got a process that we know works. We get resources for the clients. The clients happy. We're happy. You know? So we would never turn work down. But, yeah, I just think it's sensible to aim for ten k. But, yeah, twenty k doesn't seem out of the ocean. Does it either?
Speaker 2: Not at all. I'll put down twenty k. So next question. What's your motivation for actually getting to twenty k?
Speaker 1: What's the motivation? So one of our e com stores requires a lot more capital to invest in. So we launched a vitamin drink to help with hangover symptoms. And we've we've got a lot of faith in this product, but we've got to really reassess the brand positioning. We've got to spend some money getting the formula developed And we believe we've got some we've got some stakeholders and investors that believe in the product as well. And we know this business model works, we need to spend money on repositioning the brand, and we know that it can be a multi million pound company if we invest time and invest money into paid ads I'm a co founder, Sean, ILS fourteen, Facebook ad expert. Yeah. So we know we've got the model to to scale paid social but we just need to reinvest a load more money into the brand positioning. So I guess a lot of the capital from our agency would go into reinvesting in ourselves Personal courses. Yeah. There's there's so much that we wanna do, especially with our brand and ourselves. So that's the motivation. The snowboard effect. We like to call. That's why our agency called snowball digital because we know that everything does snowball and it's all leveraged against each other. So I guess to answer your question in layman terms, We know that by making more money through our agency, we can ten x our other incomes.
Speaker 2: Mhmm. That's good. I like the name too. Like the compound compound effect.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Literally.
Speaker 2: So how would the business actually change if you got to twenty k a month?
Speaker 1: So we need to invest some money on recipe development, so tweaking our recipe. We'd obviously have more money to play around on with paid ads influencers. So do you want a whole ambassador scheme? We want we want, like, a hundred influencers running an ambassador scheme. There's so much that we want to trial and error. Mhmm. And I think generating more capital through this agency will just allow us to try different things and see what works. That's cool. So I
Speaker 2: don't have that many questions left. So I'll just get through the last seven quickly just so I can understand. So you're currently at six k break written pounds, and you want to get to twenty k. What do you think is stopping you from getting there on your own?
Speaker 1: Just the mass outreach approach like I say, we really need to focus on client work. And we can't afford to spend our day looking for ideal clients tracking the tracking the open, sending personalized follow ups. So it's just not a great use of our time. We've gotta jump on calls and and brand development meetings for our other recomp stores. So the thing that's slowing us down is is the outreach and the high quality outreach as well. Because any anyone could find a hundred leads. I'm sure I could myself find hundred leads in the next hour and just spam them with our six deep email outreach, but they're not gonna be high quality leads, and they're probably not gonna convert. So it's it's a little bit more spending time on the research and the the analysis behind it.
Speaker 2: Cool. So you're currently at six k. Why not just stay where you are?
Speaker 1: So it is a good question. It is a good question, but human nature, I guess. Mhmm. Human nature. No one likes to platter out and remain where they are. And I think in the industry we're in as well. We've always we wanna diversify our portfolio with different brands, see what works for them on TikTok. Because all of the knowledge, it just gets reinvested. So if we work to work with, I don't know, you could do some outreach and find a really cool vitamin drink We take them on board as a client. We post some cool content for those. We do some deep analysis into TikTok. The video for them goes viral or we can replicate the same thing for our own e com stores then. So, yeah, we're just really aware that everything's fully intertwined and we never we never wanna plateau plateau in any area.
Speaker 2: I like the answer. I like the ambition. So when do you wanna fix this problem?
Speaker 1: Hopefully, he started today, bro. Okay.
Speaker 2: Well, Jake, based on what you said, I'm done with the questions. And I have a lot of confidence that I definitely think we can help you. Would you like me to explain a bit more about, you know, what we do? Yeah. Sure. Let's go. So in short, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agencies we work with are making between four and ten k per month with the goal of getting to around fifteen to thirty k. Typically, these agencies are doing all the outreach, all the service delivery. The owners are doing all of this themselves. And we help them to free up time, take more of an ownership role, and instead of working in the business, help them work on the business by creating reliable and automated client acquisition systems. Mhmm. Would you like some more info?
Speaker 1: Yes, please. That sounds good so far, though.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. So first, we'll begin by figuring out your target audience We'll then reconstruct your offer to make it as powerful and attractive to your niche as humanly possible. Next, we'll take this offer and craft a highly resonant message will be used in all your outreach messages. Then we'll place your powerful messaging into highly personalized outreach campaigns that are then sent to prospects that are in huge need of your services. At this time, you can expect meetings to be booked automatically, and the best part is it can be scaled up or down depending on whether you're able to take on new clients or not. So at this point, your marketing will be fully automated, bringing in a consistent flow of, you know, highly qualified meetings. Yep. Do you have any questions?
Speaker 1: Take you then. You hear me, bro. You got me, bro? Yeah. Sorry. No. No questions. That that sounds perfect. That sounds good. Deal. It's exactly what we're looking for. And I've got I've got no doubt set when we plug you in. We can start to get our calendar's book to what you say that we love jumping on discovery course of clients. So we had we had a day when when we first launched the agency, we had one week where we had about three calls per day for a week. And that that was when we had most of our calls. And you just get both and you get hyped up So yeah. Yeah. We'd we'd love it if our calendar is full of course. Because we know we can sell them. We get the clients on a course. If they're fit for our for our services. They'd be stupid to tell that's why I really like our business model because we almost make the clients feel like they're stupid to turn down this offer. Yeah. So when we get them on a call, they convert so that sounds brilliant.
Speaker 2: Excellent. So the last thing is the pricing as always. Yeah. Would you like me to go into a a detail about that? Yes, please. So as I mentioned, it is pay on result, but there is a setup fee of one thousand dollars from there, you never have to pay us again until you get show ups with highly qualified prospects. And for these appointments, it's simply one hundred dollars per show up. Not per appointment, per show up.
Speaker 0: Yep.
Speaker 2: Yep. And that is it.
Speaker 1: Let's set a fair of a thousand pound, and then it's per bushel. So there's no percentage commission if they convert. No?
Speaker 2: No. Folios.
Speaker 1: Four hundred dollars. Yeah. Key. And with regards to your outreach process of finding clients, what what process that you use? Do you find personalized emails from LinkedIn? Or do you just scrape, like, use tools like Snuff dot io? Or what's your outreach process like?
Speaker 2: We use a combination of many approaches. However, we tend to stay away from I call them software lists where you just yeah. You know what I mean? Because everyone -- Yeah. -- is the same leads. That this
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Few people yeah. Look, we've we've been done the route. We've been using d seven lead finder before. Yeah. Yeah. We would guess we would like this. So many leads on here, but then we step back and forth. We can get them every other agency in the world to probably use them.
Speaker 2: Literally. So we use a combination of LinkedIn, Google Search, Facebook, Instagram. Anything we can get.
Speaker 0: Okay. Yep.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. Yeah. So let me tie in with my co founder then because we we've obviously, we can allocate budget to reach out because we know we it's gonna probably come back ten x if we get in our calendar high quality leads. So let me just run this past him. See see his take on it, and then we can get going as soon as, yeah, as soon as Tamara if if he wants to go ahead.
Speaker 2: Perfect. If you'd like, we can set up another call with him, and I can answer any questions that he may have if you'd like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Let me I'll ring you now and then I'll I'll drop you an email or a channel link then and we'll get a second discovery call. Because I'm sure he will have some questions. So, yeah, that'd be odd then.
Speaker 2: Perfect. Do you know a specific date? Where you can make
Speaker 1: a Wednesday, Wednesday's work. Wednesday's tend to work best. Wednesday afternoon, maybe two PM. So say two PM, Wednesday?
Speaker 2: Perfect. I'll send a calendar link and we can talk on LinkedIn about this.
Speaker 1: Yes. Sure. Okeydoke. Thank you for your time, Ethan. It's been really good insight. Mhmm.
Speaker 2: Do you have any further questions before we end it up?
Speaker 1: No questions for myself. No?
Speaker 2: Perfect. One was great speaking to you today. Great meeting you. Yes, sir. Thank you. Take care. Thank you. Have a great
