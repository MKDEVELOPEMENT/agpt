Speaker 0:  Yeah. It's open.
Speaker 1: Julie. Good morning.
Speaker 0: Hey. How are you?
Speaker 1: Doing excellent. How are you?
Speaker 0: Good.
Speaker 1: It's great to hear. That's a nice picture on the back. So kind of
Speaker 0: It's a blue heron.
Speaker 1: Blue heron? Alright. Let me
Speaker 0: get one of the poo out of the picture. Sure. There we go.
Speaker 1: Otherwise, how's your week been?
Speaker 0: It's been great. Mhmm. Bosses are out of town. Get some work done?
Speaker 1: Nice, man. Nice. Alright. Cool. I don't wanna take up too much time on a Friday. I was looking forward to this call. I really wanted to see how we could potentially help you out. And if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you'd like.
Speaker 0: Why don't you tell me some more about it? Mhmm. And then I can talk to Mark and Rebecca next week.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. Alright. Fantastic. And I'll just record the call to make sure everything's everything's clear. Alright. So fantastic. So to give a quick overview, all the calls usually go. I typically just wanna starting for us with some quick questions right after I explain a bit about what we do. And then assuming, you know, everything's good, after the questions, assuming everything's clear, then I'll walk you through in more detail how they offer works, and then we can go from there. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 0: That's perfect.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool. So to give the shortest overview on what we do, is that we help establish marketing agencies on average add an extra fifty to one hundred thousand dollars per month by building out client acquisition machine. So we usually do this within around six to nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help to solve is client acquisition. Right? Usually, these agencies, they have all the foundations in place already. They have the systems. They have the team. They have amazing client results They're grown from a photos which just indicates that your clients love what you're doing. They have a sales process that's proven to work and they have people to take the calls. The only thing stopping them from scaling up or hitting whatever the revenue goals are is speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day And if they can do that, if they can get in contact with people that can afford their services, can afford high retainers that want what they're offering, they can speak to them every single day, scale becomes pretty much inevitable. Is everything clear there?
Speaker 0: Yeah. That makes complete sense.
Speaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. So The first thing that I want to ask because, again, I was looking forward to the call is what made you wanna schedule the call in the first
Speaker 0: place? We are looking to grow. With coming off of COVID, things have stagnated a little bit, and then it's, you know, It's time.
Speaker 1: A hundred percent. So after COVID things started stagnating, started slowing down?
Speaker 0: They slowed down a little bit, not a lot. In COVID, but we're at a point where our team is solid. Mhmm. And we can afford to and want to grow But you get into into that cycle of, you know, you've got leads that you've had for five or six years and they just you know, they haven't gone anywhere. You you get a couple bites here and there, but we we need to find a mechanism to start moving forward.
Speaker 1: Like a a more predictable way of getting these clients signed as opposed to just hearing that.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And and getting things that are real targeted where we used to go with a lower level client. We're in a position now to go with much higher level clients and breaking into know, the realm of where a global agency would be offering services isn't as easy for a boutique agency.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent because you guys clearly have a solid foundation. I think you have, like, multiple locations as well. Correct? Mhmm. Fantastic. So just so that we can get an actual metric on it. What's your goal? Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna be?
Speaker 0: I would say, probably at three to four million.
Speaker 1: Per month appear?
Speaker 0: Per year.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Speaker 0: I mean, per month would be lovely. But but that that also would require a lot of
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Internal structural growth.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. The back end on three million per month would be quite quite complex. Alright. Cool. Perfect. Three to four million per year. How far is that from you guys are right now?
Speaker 0: Double?
Speaker 1: Double. Cool. So about, you know, one to two million player?
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: Cool. Cool. So it seems correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems simple enough. The goal is to go from one point two million PR to three point three to four. The only thing stopping from getting there is just signing more clients. And if you can do that consistently, then we'll hit the target. K. Alright. Cool. Perfect. So the next thing that I just wanna go into is exactly who you want to work with. Because like you mentioned, you're at you have the capabilities of going after bigger clients, more established ones. You have choice of who you want to work with, who is your ideal client.
Speaker 0: We were primarily e commerce and franchise organizations. We work we work with franchise owners, not franchisees.
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: I mean, we work with them by extension, but our contracts are generally with a franchisor or large e commerce. Somebody like, we do some work with universal, They're they're a great client for us. We do a lot in the b d b space. We worked with Linux. For quite a while. Yes. So those are the types the the larger types of clients we would be looking for, you know, If we could pick off Blue Nile, that would be lovely.
Speaker 1: That would be a nice one. Have you ever heard of Ili cafe or five hour energy? No. No. Wow. Alright. Never mind then. I think they are probably like the biggest coffee brand. One of the biggest coffee brands in the world. I think we just booked a meeting with them today for one of our clients in e commerce. But just to get some context, obviously, e commerce is a very broad service b to b, service franchises. Yeah. Is there anything more specific that you're looking for in these specific industries?
Speaker 0: No. We work across verticals.
Speaker 1: Cool.
Speaker 0: We're we're looking for people who can afford a ten at least a ten thousand dollars retainer for Search engine optimization.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Perfect. That's great. So it's not we don't want the small brands, the people just starting out the a guy that just put up his website. We want the established brands seven eight nine figure brands only.
Speaker 0: Exactly.
Speaker 1: Alright. Perfect. That makes a lot more sense. So it's not just in order to get to three to four million EPS, not just a matter of getting you in contact with e commerce brands or B2B businesses. It's the established ones. The ones who have the existing foundation, the ones who have the money that can afford a ten k a month retainer.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. Cool. And right now, what are you currently doing to attract these type of clients?
Speaker 0: We we obviously have our website working for for wheat. A lot of our business comes from referrals from our current clients. Mhmm. We do we do some outbound
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Email. Mhmm. I'm sorry. It's a little early for me yet. I need to think very early in the morning.
Speaker 1: Coffee healthy health.
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I'm doing. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: But I figured it was pretty late for you, so I wasn't gonna ask to push it back. Oh,
Speaker 1: no. It's actually only two thirty PM. We could've pushed it back. Yeah. Either way.
Speaker 0: Well, I got your work on time.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see that.
Speaker 0: What are we doing? Our CEO is the one who handles most of our biz dev, so we do a lot of a lot of networking. Mhmm. We we do some stuff with LinkedIn. The answer is we don't have a specific protocol other than doing continual outreach.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: We have and doing multiple touch points We have a a newsletter, an ongoing newsletter. We have some pretty decent social putting some things out there. To keep our name out there. We have people who do some writing -- Mhmm. -- for some of the you know, do some thought leadership kind of things. That's kinda where we're at.
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good. The thing I always like to hear is that you're growing from a folks because that's just an indicator that you're great at what you're doing. So growing from a photo, some outbound emails, some outbound LinkedIn, networking, mainly done by CEO, people doing some writing and then some new sales, so some inbound work as well. Correct? Mhmm. Cool. And correct me if I'm wrong, but with the referrals you can't really choose exactly who you want to work with. So this is -- Correct.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: along with other clients. Yeah. So obviously, you can get new business in, but you kind of have to take whatever comes to you because you can't really be proactive as to exactly who you want to work with. So we can't you're not specifically getting, you know, e commerce brands, making seven figures per year with a great service, with a great founder.
Speaker 0: So Exactly.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Alright. Cool. Glad we're on the same page because this is generally something I get every single day with our current clients. And with, you know, calls like these. So cool is it seems simple enough. And the CEO is managing most of the best of himself.
Speaker 0: Yes. He's he is particular when we take on clients. We we kind of audition them while they're auditioning us to make sure that they're going to be a good fit. Our team is made of senior level people. You have to have ten years of experience in what you do to be even be considered for a job here.
Speaker 1: Yes.
Speaker 0: So it's you know, the the people that we have are not inexpensive. Yeah. But they're very, very good at what they do.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And so we're not going to bring in a client that we don't believe we can make successful because SEO is one of those things where it takes time and trust. Mhmm. And there's some really bad SEO firms out there where people that say they know how to do it and they really don't Yeah. So we make sure that we're setting ourselves as well as our clients up for success and it there are clients that have prospects that have come to us that in the end, we decide not to work with them. We're like, look, you know, we we've looked at all your stuff.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: And the reality is, you're gonna give us a bunch of money and we're not gonna be able to help you for these reasons.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: So Mark likes to say stay very intimately involved in the process. Best so that he's setting both our clients up for success as well as our team because you don't wanna take someone on that's just internally frustrating. To themselves and to us because that doesn't really help with our emotional balance. And and, I mean, Yeah. Only is one thing, but making sure that we're taking on the right things matters.
Speaker 1: That's an extremely small point. And that's the same reason we extend our own sales cycle because after the short term money, okay, cool. But if you're working with them on a long term basis, and your team has to work them every day and they're frustrating, you you know, can't get results for whatever reason. It's it's not worth it. In terms of the long term consequences. So rate point. Alright. Cool. So I know you mentioned you guys are you guys are clearly excellent at what you do. Ten plus years' experience just to get like an opportunity there. That's amazing. Do any of them have experience in sort of business outbound lead generation?
Speaker 0: No.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. Cool. Just ask because, obviously, you guys are great at what you do. But if you're using that time doing, for example, lead generation, like, sending emails as opposed to SEO, which you guys are experts in is probably not the best the best use of your time. Either way. Cool. And one of the last things I want to ask is when are you actually looking to start signing more clients looking to start scaling up.
Speaker 0: Now now is good.
Speaker 1: Good answer. Not end of q four or anything like that.
Speaker 0: No. No. No. No. There's March is a vacation time, so we've got a little a little bit of stuff with that, but I would say probably April first. We would be ready to --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 0: -- we'd have time to get our ducks in a row and -- Yeah. -- and start really focused sitting on it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Because by the time the vacation things done, we can just get everything set up. Yeah. Alright. Cool. Perfect. Then based on that and correct me if I'm wrong, but just to recap, you're currently at around one to two millennia, the goal is to get to three to four millennia. You guys clearly, clearly have all the foundations in place. You have a phenomenal team. I mean, needing ten plus years of experience just to get an opportunity that's insanely good. You have an amazing team. You have the systems. You have happy clients because you're growing off referrals. You have a sales process that's proven to convert. The only thing stopping from going to or from one point two to three point four, three two four, is signing more clients. And we can just get you in contact with more qualified clients, qualified e commerce brands, b to b businesses that can pay you ten thousand dollars per month, and you can speak to them every single all day, I mean, getting there will be pretty straightforward. Is anything I missed that?
Speaker 0: Nope. You got a nice straight line there.
Speaker 1: I like that. Alright. In that case, you're like ninety nine percent of the agencies we work with. Because they all face very similar issues in terms of looking to scale up. Do you mind if I share what the next step to be?
Speaker 0: I think that'd be fabulous.
Speaker 1: Me too. So like I was saying, I genuinely think you're a great fit. And to give a quick overview, just like we spoke about at the start of what we do, is we help establish marketing agencies, typically add an extra fifty to a hundred thousand dollars per month within six to nine months by building out the client acquisition machines. And like I was saying, you have all the foundations ready. It's really just a matter of getting in contact with more of these audio prospects every single day. And we can do that consistently and predictably as opposed to sporadic inbound from referrals or, you know, LinkedIn or networking. Then scale will be it'll be comfortable. It'll be straightforward because everything will be based off of the numbers. So would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a custom much proposal on exactly how things can help you reach, you know, three to four million per year.
Speaker 0: That would be great. And we could include Mark in that call because he'll be back in the office.
Speaker 1: That's amazing. Do you know when you'll be back?
Speaker 0: Next week.
Speaker 1: Next week. Alright. Fantastic. Okay. I'm just pulling up my calendar quick. I don't want you to be on a call too early next time. We can push it back a bit later. Hopefully. Let me just
Speaker 0: Where are you?
Speaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now.
Speaker 0: I have not. No. That is one of those places I would like to go, but I haven't. I have some friends that were missionaries there for years. Mhmm. I absolutely loved it.
Speaker 1: Beautiful place.
Speaker 0: And I understand that to be the case.
Speaker 1: Alright. So I'm just gonna send over a scheduling link. And then if any of these prompts work for you, just let me
Speaker 0: Okay. Wednesday or Wednesday, probably.
Speaker 1: Tuesday or Wednesday?
Speaker 0: Yeah. I'm looking at his calendar. Mhmm.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool.
Speaker 0: Alright. Tuesday's way better than Wednesday. I had to look at my calendar too.
Speaker 1: Perfect. Do any of these times work for you?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Let's call it at ten, my ten.
Speaker 1: I was curious about the role of chief happiness coordinator. Never heard that one before.
Speaker 0: My job is a lot of things like everyone else here, I had to have more than ten years experience to get this job. Yeah. A second loop at work on here. The happiness part of my job is twofold. One is quality assurance with our clients. I speak with them on a regular basis to make sure that we are meeting their expectations. If there's any tweaks we can make, we try and do that. It's also an opportunity to try and sell organic growth. Within our clients to kinda see what's coming.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: So if there's something that we can do that'll help us grow with our current clients that being a little bit easier because you already know what you're getting into. I also make sure that, you know, they get pizza and lunch on their birthday and stuff like that. Internally, I work with our chief of operations to make sure that everything is running smoothly within the team and do things with them to make sure that our team is also happy that they're getting what they need, that if there's, you know, sometimes we're pretty small organization. So, yeah, there's not a lot of water cooler talk and we're virtual, so we don't sit in the same room. Mhmm. But there's times you don't wanna go to the boss with something, but you need somebody to ask a question or whatever. So I kind of fill that role. I also help Mark with biz dev. I've got thirty years in marketing. So this is kind of my summer retirement job.
Speaker 1: You must be vulnerable people.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's It's one of my superpowers.
Speaker 1: Can imagine. Team of love.
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, I'm kind of the utility player. I can I can do a lot of things? I worked for large agencies, so I know how to put proposals together to resonate with CMOs. I know there's there's a lot of things that I do here. So
Speaker 1: That's interesting. My focus is also a lot on people, so I'm always looking to learn. That sounds amazing. Alright. Julie was great speaking as always. And
Speaker 0: -- Okay. -- the one thing that I do that I do need to be able to answer for Mark before he'll get on a call with you, is how does this work from a financial standpoint?
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's a great question. So the way we structure the pricing is we work on a retainer plus percentage of revenue generated. Alright? So to give some more context onto this, it's usually a flat retainer. And plus, for example, if you if we help you sign a twenty thousand dollar per month retainer yourself, we will take, for example, nine percent of the first month. And that's really there just to incentivize us doing the best possible job for you and making sure that your team closes the deal because we see a lot of agencies they They work on a flat retainer, and they have no real incentive to get you guys increasingly good results. So we like to make sure we both want the same thing. And that's why we do it that way.
Speaker 0: Okay. So the percentage would only apply to the first month that wouldn't apply to a full year contract.
Speaker 1: Correct.
Speaker 0: Okay. And what does your average retainer look like?
Speaker 1: Sure. So on average, the retainers can vary from three thousand one hundred to seven thousand dollars per month. And again, this really varies depending on the complexity of the project. Mhmm. But if it's if you run a single service to one ICP, it's it's not there's not much complexity there. But for others, you know, they wanna add an extra five hundred thousand per month and extra potentially even million per month. So there's a lot more things running, and that's where the price really increases. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Yeah. We'd love to do that, but that would also require every month increasing our infrastructure and that just --
Speaker 1: Mhmm.
Speaker 0: -- that setting up that setting us up for failure. You need to make sure that you can scale both at the same time.
Speaker 1: That's a great point. And to a degree, it does. But on the other end, is that Imagine you had complete choice of who you want to work with. So if you only worked with luxury fashion brands in e commerce, Imagine how much more simplified your delivery would be as opposed to working with b to b e commerce, the pizza shop down the road, So by actually choosing one ICP and sticking to that, it's actually gonna add a lot of simplicity to your actual delivery. Well, Lisa's what we found based on our post lines.
Speaker 0: Oh, that well, it makes sense if you have people trying to work at a particular vertical --
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- then then it's, you know, wash rins repeat.
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. That's the same reason we only work with established marketing agencies because we can really streamline the delivery.
Speaker 0: Okay. Alright. Great. Well, if you would be so kind as to send me the recording of this call so he can review it in advance. Sure. I will talk to him when he gets back, and we'll see if this is something he has an appetite for.
Speaker 1: Perfect. So to give some quick context between now and the actual call, obviously, I'll send through the recording. I'll confirm everything through email, through LinkedIn. And between now and then, either myself or someone else in the team will reach out to you and whoever else is coming on the call just to make sure everything went well, just to confirm the next one, And then in the actual proposal call, assuming everything's good, we'll go through a ton of case studies of agencies exactly like yours. Our exact process, so you could do this with or without us. And then the additional details like pricing, outworks, implementation, things like that. Is that okay with you?
Speaker 0: That's perfect. Thank you, Ethan.
Speaker 1: Alright. Cool. Julie, Chris speaking, and I'll talk to you on the twenty first of March.
Speaker 0: Great. You have a good weekend.
Speaker 1: You too. See
