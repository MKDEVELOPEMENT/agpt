Speaker 0:  Hey.
Speaker 1: How you doing?
Speaker 0: Aaron's, man. How are you?
Speaker 1: I'm good, man. It's good to connect finally.
Speaker 0: So glad we finally got this call scheduled after, well, three weeks.
Speaker 1: Yeah. That's quite some time.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So That's good. Everything's good, man. Just eating out of meetings all day, just typical Yeah. You know, daily motion, man. That's just how it goes.
Speaker 0: Yeah. See the sticky nose in the back, man. That's when you look at it.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Just a lot going on, man. That's it. You know?
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. Honestly, I was looking forward to the call. I really wanted to see how we could potentially help you out. So if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I was talking about it.
Speaker 0: Alright. Perfect. So other calls usually go very simple. I just wanna start a pause with some quick questions. Help me understand where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially help you get there, Obviously, we've seen, like, good foot. I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works, every other detail, and then we can go from there. Is that cool here?
Speaker 1: Sounds good.
Speaker 0: Pleasure. Alright. Cool. What made you wanna call schedule the call in the first place?
Speaker 1: Well, I'm looking for out sourcing to be able to, you know, filter in more leads and developing a proper system and doing that. We scaled very quickly. So things kinda got out of hand. Right? And not only that, the way we're developing our leads and stuff is kinda like one system that's not necessarily you know, we haven't even really done ads yet. We we funnel through specific platforms. Right? We just started email campaigning and stuff. But, I mean, I just wanna be able to have this together properly, have a working them so that I'm able to follow my lead journey in regards to, you know, potential clients easier to follow-up and be able to integrate specific platforms that would help me do that. And not only that, talk to more people, get more leads in. So I'm trying to scale where I'm trying to go right now, we're around, like, thirty clients. I'm trying to scale to about fifty to a hundred.
Speaker 2: Nice.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Amazing. We'll see. Currently, at around thirty clients, the goals get around fifty to a hundred. Yep. Nice. Okay. Cool. So just to summarize everything, the goal right now is to create a system that allows you to get more leads, sign more clients, scale up predictably, systematically, chose for a large follow the lead journey from start to finish. They have clarity on everything. You've also just got an email at the same time. You really just want a system that works to do this. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Cool. So you wanna go from thirty clients to fifty to a hundred. On average, how much are you charging per client right now?
Speaker 1: Right now, I'd say my average is between two thousand monthly USD to above five, six thousand. Cool.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Two to six k per month. That's amazing. And out of curiosity, why fifty to a hundred? Why that number?
Speaker 1: Well, that's my number where I can replace myself. Afford someone to replace myself. Right now, we have about fifteen consultants. We're just bringing on quality control consultant regards to content creation. So we're around, like, sixteen people involved in the team now. So I wanna be able to be in a position to replace myself and be able to have, you know, my team be able to handle, you know, incoming calls, leads, and that's generated without me always having to be in front of the client, and that's gonna be a numbers game. Because when I started consulting and building my business, I was in front of every single client and I still I mean, with lots of clients weekly, like, I have minimum five, six meetings a day, Monday through Friday, and it's just nonstop. So it's just kinda like we have to scale our our way of getting the clients, getting them in, getting them onboarded, and allowing myself to alleviate that time. Right?
Speaker 0: And yeah.
Speaker 1: The only way we're gonna do that is with numbers. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Numbers are consistency. That's honestly something we hear over and over with the clients who work now. You know, usually, they're the founders. They're the owners. They started everything, but they're doing everything themselves. Yeah. So they're doing sales. But they're also managing the team. But they're also helping the clients, and they're also helping with the accounting. So it's it's just crazy. Think if we can start by systemizing every aspect of the business starting with the acquisition, which is probably the most urgent point now, we can systematically that and it should help to remove you pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Perfect. So just so we get an idea of who you actually wanna speak to because, you know, we wanna speak to them every day, who's your ideal client actually look like?
Speaker 1: Well, our ideal client would be, like, a midsized company or start up, right, new business development. Right? I I would say that's what we've been going off after, that's why hence my acquisition cost. Right? Is I mean, what I'm spending what clients are spending monthly is what it is, right, because of where they're at, right, and who we're targeting. So a lot of our clients, you know what I mean, any range from homebuilders to law firms. We have G's. We have node investing companies, publishing companies, We have business coaches. We do their marketing and stuff for event planners, digital assets. So it ranges. We're pretty, like, technical that way with our with our niche. Like, it's hard to narrow it down, but we started collecting, like, emails and scraping and stuff in regards to the majority of clients we had, so about sixty percent of our clients have to do with homebuilding and construction and stuff. So we've kind of found a void in that industry where a lot of these companies lack, you know what I mean, our services and lack that of digital awareness. So I mean, that's a great place to start. We have some geographic areas as well that we've kinda noticed are really easy to kinda slide through and they're you know what I mean? A lack of our our services around. So we have that data and everything like that. It's just now executing and and being able to make that happen. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Hundred percent. That's amazing. Some midsize companies some examples, homebuilders, law firms, publishing companies, coaches, events, planners. You guys are clearly amazing at what you do. Just from the fact you can help all of these different niches, you know -- Yeah. -- doing the same. This so that's amazing. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And if out of curiosity, if you were to pick one Do you have a favorite?
Speaker 1: The favorite that I work with, I would have to say, that's a tough one. Yeah. I I I I wouldn't say I necessarily have a favorite man. I I would say in regards to what I feel is cut in cookie dry where we'd be able to get a lot of clients in a systematic form, like, you know, onboarding in in work process. I would say something to do with homebuilding construction, housing, node investing, like, housing stuff. Right? The housing market.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Alright. Cool. That's I
Speaker 1: mean, right now, that's the bubble. Right? There's there's inflation. There's there's, you know, interest rates going up. You know, the housing market is gonna turn into a buyer's market here soon for people that are able to do things. So a lot of people are gonna lean towards that to build their business. So,
Speaker 0: yeah, that's a really good point, actually. Yeah. That's perfect. And obviously, you know, if we say mid sized company, it can mean a lot of different things. It can be a pretty, you know, broad statement If you have an idea of what your unideal client would look like, what would that
Speaker 1: be? I would say An ideal. I I would probably say a client that's probably has, you know, we're talking numbers wise, I would say anything over, like, a hundred and fifty, two hundred employees.
Speaker 0: Do you
Speaker 1: know what I mean? Like, once you start getting into that range, you become a number and you're very easily replaceable. And if there's not a touch point anymore, it's kind of more or less, like, if there's it loses the authenticity of you know, feeling our efforts, you know, making a difference for them. Right? Because it's such a large organization. So I mean, like but that's just from my perception of what we've been doing. So I really don't know that other side. Do you know what I mean?
Speaker 0: Yep. So, yeah, that's a good point because anything over a hundred two hundred employees. It's just, like, purely transactional. They just see US. It's
Speaker 1: purely transactional. Yeah. And on Germany, it's tough and that's those situations. Right? Because the turnover rates are usually pretty quick. They jump agency to agency. You know what I mean? Like, there's no there's no relationship. So why would the the relationship be long? Right?
Speaker 0: Exactly. They just if they just see a bad number, then it's over the next one. Right?
Speaker 1: Fun.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's true. Alright. Cool. So just to recap everything, you're currently around thirty clients. And because you're charging around two to six k a month, just to extrapolate that, you add around thirty or sixty to a hundred k a month, that'd be great. Cool. And then No.
Speaker 1: Right now right now we're doing around last month, we did around forty something k.
Speaker 0: Forty k. That's perfect. And then in terms of goal, obviously, the goal is fifty to hundred clients. Do you have a revenue amount that you're aiming for?
Speaker 1: Yes. I I wanna make anywhere between sixty to a hundred thousand a month.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent. Honestly, based on our past clients, that's extremely doable. To go from e to sixty to a hundred k? That's the goal? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Cool. So, I mean, based on that, you wanna go from forty k to sixty to a hundred? Yeah. Do you have things consistently? Yeah. What's this differently?
Speaker 1: Because I know this game, this game sometimes in regards to clients the client lifeline usually is like, you know, they start evaluating things or they get what they want within, like, a three to four quarter frame.
Speaker 0: So a
Speaker 1: lot of clients around that frame start to, you know, shift or they go part time or you know what I mean? Like, sometimes that's when we have interruption. In our monthly income. So I know it's so important having clients consistently coming in. Right?
Speaker 0: That's such a good point, and I'm so glad you go that up because this is one of the things that we implement for our clients now in regards to their offer and increasing the LTV of their clients. Because what we found is that if they don't have the right system in place, clients will get what they want and then think, yeah. Okay. I got it now. Let's, you know, stop at this point.
Speaker 1: Or I can do it myself
Speaker 0: or something. That's the big one.
Speaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: So some of the things we implement are systems to make you more the word that we use is sticky to the clients. Yeah. Right? Implementing ways where you are more integrated into their business. And because of this, they kind of need to work with you. And it's in their best interest, of course, because you're, you know, helping them with them all to help them make more money. So -- Yeah. -- if we can also get you in contact with the qualified prospects, but also implement ways so that you keep them for longer. I think it's just gonna add a lot of peace of mind, especially if you're planning on removing yourself from the process? Because the last thing you want after you remove yourself is for clients to start leaving.
Speaker 3: Exactly. Right? Yeah.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. So, I mean, just to summarize how we spoke about, the goal is to go from forty k to sixty to a hundred k. And the only thing stopping you from getting there is signing more clients consistently. Right? Yeah. You clearly have all the foundations in place already. I mean, to be at the point we are now thirty clients. Your clients clearly love you. You're clearly doing a great job. Right? I don't think you can sell. You probably have all the systems in place already to take on more clients. You probably have results as well. So the only thing stopping you from going from thirty clients to fifty to a hundred is just speaking to more qualified prospects every single day. Yes.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Every that'd be amazing, man. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Like, And I'm not gonna you know, I like to simplify things because a lot of these people that come on the call and say, yeah, you need this paid acquisition method and this weird five step process It's like, it's that's it. So if you wanna get you to forty or from forty to a hundred k, it's really not gonna be a complex process. Mhmm. Because it's not like you're charging twenty dollars per client. It's two to six thousand. So realistically, we only need a couple of clients every single month. And if you just speak to them every days, you know, selling them will be pretty much inevitable. Right?
Speaker 1: Yes. It's a numbers game. Exactly.
Speaker 0: Yeah, then. Alright. Yeah. So some of the last things I just wanna figure out is what you're currently doing right now to attract clients. Just so I know anything is an issue right now. So do you mind sharing what you're doing right now?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So, basically, what we do is I have about four different sales guys, I guess, you per say, Three of them are now sending emails consistently through our listing, through like, trying to qualify our own leads and send emails of just introductory and stuff like that, like copy. And then I have one that utilizes things like Upwork and stuff and goes in contract tools and attracts clients that way and we feed them in. As of now, we're trying to get them when we feed them in, get them off of Upwork, and then get them started on our own basis. And if not, as well, Upwork's been really good to us. Like, we have gotten we've had at least, like, sixty clients, like, come through Upwork, like, in and out, like, that we've had in Lifeline.
Speaker 0: Nice. Nice. Yeah. So the main ones right now is email and upload. Correct?
Speaker 1: Pretty much.
Speaker 3: Perfect. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. And let's start with the email. How's it working out? How are the results?
Speaker 1: We actually just started it, like, two weeks ago because I was like, we need to do more, and that's hence the reason for this call because I understood, you know, we can't put all our eggs in one basket. I need to if I'm gonna really build this out, I need to have leads coming in from, like, five, six different ways. And I wouldn't be able to do it properly. So, like, for me to do it properly, can I create those funnels and do specific things myself? Yeah. Probably. But that takes time. And that takes my execution. And that's something I don't have.
Speaker 0: Exactly. And like we said, the goal is to move yourself in the first place. So giving us
Speaker 3: access. That's just putting
Speaker 0: more work.
Speaker 1: And I mean, yes, it gives more, but it's more work to do more work, and that's great. It's just and it'd be never and never ending cycle. It'd never stop. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. And honestly, the fact that you even mentioned this just shows a level of self awareness that ninety nine percent of people don't have. Because people just don't think this way because they don't realize by you doing the work, Yes. You can get it done. It might it may take for, like, a long time. You can get it done. By the time that you spent doing that, you could have been doing high leverage tasks. Like, hiring
Speaker 1: more people. That's what I mean. Right? Like, that's you know, where I can really work on my business and think I have time to think. I just have they don't even have time to do that. I'm doing sixteen hour days for the last two years, man.
Speaker 0: Oh, man. Exactly. But yeah. I think you're taking the right steps. Hundred percent, you're definitely taking the right steps. So let's just figure out what the next steps are to actually get this get you out of the actual day today. So -- Yeah. -- you started email right now. Mhmm. Pretty pretty new. Are you looking to implement more systems? Just so I know.
Speaker 1: Yes. An effective ones. Right? And and having that you know, whatever platforms we need to like, we'll we'll get sometimes we'll get, like, I would say on average, we're probably signing about two to three new clients a month. Hey. About that, two to three. Mhmm. I usually have about four interviews on average a week. Probably about that. We're our close rates usually, like, twenty percent probably. So every, like,
Speaker 0: I
Speaker 1: would say every ten we get two contracts, comp interviews. Perfect.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Cool. How many calls would you be able to have with the day? Or would the business be?
Speaker 1: You give me twenty. I'll do it.
Speaker 3: And I have a team, so we'll do it.
Speaker 0: That is perfect.
Speaker 3: I need to hire someone to assist the bot. We'll do it. That's what it is.
Speaker 0: That is that is what I loved. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So that's email. That's getting you around four opportunities a week.
Speaker 1: I would say that mix with Upwork. It's the two right now because we just started email. So a lot of that was Upwork.
Speaker 0: Oh, okay. I see. I see. Cool. And obviously, I I hear people using Upwork all the time. How is the actual quality of the people that are coming from Upwork?
Speaker 1: Like I said, we have some clients that are only paying a thousand dollars a month. We have a couple. Right? And I mean, like, you run into a lot of, like, stickiness in regards to some newer clients, like, asking too much or too little, you know, or not having the adequate budget. But, I mean, at the same there's still a place for them at the end of the day if I have the hands and the margin. Right? So to make it work, and I think we've kind of figured those margins out in a sense to start being, you know, profitable. Right? Because our overhead isn't super, super high right now, other than, like, platforms we're using consultant fees that I'm, you know, the team And then now, you know, external efforts like administration, being able to accounting, like, organizing our invoices and connecting with clients, like, all that kind of stuff we then that's the time that doesn't really have ROI that we're spending. Right?
Speaker 0: That's true. That's true. Yeah. Because honestly, to give some context, what we've been seeing with you know, I mean, I speak to agent service every day. A ton of them are using Upwork. And what we find from our book is they can get interest, but it's not the type of interest that they want. So for example, it's people who like, price shopping, so they'll compare ten different agencies at the same time. Like, they just look at you as another number, go with the cheapest one and hope for the best. Or they just
Speaker 3: Yeah. Just pay for the best -- Yep.
Speaker 0: -- pretty much. Like -- Yeah. -- you could be delivering a service ten times better than everyone else but they'll see this guy oh, he's from Philippines. He can do it for twenty bucks. Okay. This is Thursday.
Speaker 1: Exactly.
Speaker 0: Like yeah. That's generally what happens. So the same in the same way, you'll get the best hires or the best hires you're not gonna get. You know, they're not just gonna sign up to work with every company. You're gonna have to go out and find them from other place. That's pretty much the same way we found to get the best clients. But, yeah, proactively reach out to them. So, I mean, that's both if you're getting around four opportunities per week with Outlook and email. And are you doing anything else?
Speaker 1: That's that's honestly it right now. The rest of all the efforts are into the actual finishing, you know, the tasks and the work and being able to you know, get the clients work done. Like, that's where we've kind of gotten to. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Honestly, I think I honestly think you're in a great situation right now. In terms of having the foundations to scale up. Right? So to summarize everything, it seems like, obviously, the goal is to go from a forty k to sixty to a hundred. Right? The only thing stopping from getting there is signing more clients. The only thing stopping from signing more clients is speaking to enough, high quality, you know, prospects that afford what you're offering or can afford what you're offering, that one but you're offering, and speaking to them every single day. And at that point, you say it's a numbers game. Right? You close the numbers game. You know your numbers. You can just get enough. You close them again. You'll hit the goal and you have to click. So if we can just solve that one problem, then, I mean, it should be pretty straightforward. So if that's the case and you're like, I'm ninety nine percent of our clients have seen great results. Do you mind if I share what the next step would be?
Speaker 1: Yes. Let's do it. What time is it? We still got lots of time. We're booked until sorry. One sec even.
Speaker 0: Oh, good. And it should've take, like, two minutes anyways.
Speaker 2: Yep. I just wanna make sure I don't know. Not rush here.
Speaker 1: Okay. I'm yeah. I'm good for another forty five minutes.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. Yeah. I've I will then come, like, forty five minutes. I actually have to run another call in five. But there
Speaker 1: you go. Okay. Then you're on the same page.
Speaker 0: Yeah. I do have to do a quick overview is that we help establish marketing agencies to increase revenue by fifty to one hundred k a month within around sixty nine months. And like we're speaking about the entire goal, the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition, right, across the board, across industries, across everything is just being able to get in contact with enough qualified prospects every single day. And if they can do that, scale is genuinely inevitable. Right? Because like you're saying, it is a numbers game. So getting from forty to a hundred k, should not be complex. It's just a matter of hitting the numbers. If we can get you in contact with a certain amount of people every week, you'll close a certain amount and we'll hit the numbers. That's exactly pretty predictable. So based on that, obviously, I have to run-in a minute of you're probably busy as well. Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up poll where I can create a customized proposal and share exactly how I think we can help you reach hundred k a month based on what you told me today?
Speaker 1: Of course. Is it possible for us to do that tonight or tomorrow?
Speaker 0: Tomorrow? I
Speaker 3: don't quit, man.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: Tomorrow Oh, tomorrow's Thursday. Is that even possible for you?
Speaker 0: Well, we move past tomorrow's symptom.
Speaker 2: Tomorrow's saying, oh, what times are we now? World traffic?
Speaker 1: Let's do it. Come in.
Speaker 0: Oh, man. You know, you are the first person. Who suggested doing it tomorrow. I I'm always the first one to suggest doing it tomorrow. But everyone was like, yeah. Okay.
Speaker 1: Yeah, man. It's I I know time was of the essence, man, and I and I'm eager to get this done, like, in a sense of setting up these systems. And not only that, I have one question for you, so your
Speaker 2: team, before you go,
Speaker 0: that you do
Speaker 1: you guys help with action? Actual execution of setting up specific integration or, like, whatever we need to, like, you know, form the actual leads and stuff. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. Do you mind just going a bit more in detail so I can be sure?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So, like, us being able to have, like, something specific like a program, not necessarily, like, Salesforce or anything. But, like, something that allowed us to be able to, you know, a CRM for us to have and track our our our our leads coming in and we see them coming in, integrated to our calendars, all that kind of stuff.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. It's completely integrated, and I'll be honest, one of our major objectives is for you to work as little as possible in the process. So the music's my responsibility. So a hundred percent, we set up the CRM completely from start finish. Assuming you don't have already, we cover everything. So CRM, you'll have all the lead details. You can just see them go throughout the process in the pipeline. We'll have all the details that'll be booked straight into a calendar. All you have to do is get on to calls and solve them.
Speaker 1: Amazing. And question,
Speaker 0: did you
Speaker 1: guys assist with any specific integration, like, in regards to, like, onboarding. So, like, trip campaigns or something when we have you can have people in, like, immediately from those leads or anything like that?
Speaker 0: In terms of prospects onboarding?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Pro prospects, I guess, per se, You know, I'm following that following up with them and stuff, like a drip campaign and all that kind of stuff?
Speaker 0: Absolutely. So We actually have two components for the follow ups. The first is group campaigns like you mentioned, but we also got a step further. And and again, this is what I'll mention in the actual proposal. As we provide so we hire manage and train a dedicated sales team that'll work for your company and, obviously, managed by us. And they'll follow-up manually as well calling them, emailing them, making sure they get onto the call are preowned.
Speaker 1: And Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Okay? No amazing. I've heard enough with us to connect tomorrow at the same time, so that would be twelve o'clock my time, twelve thirty my time. MST. So how do I do this? Do I send you an invite? Are you gonna send me an invite?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Don't worry about it at all. Straight off of this call, I'm gonna send an invite And what's gonna happen after that is either myself or someone in the team will reach out to you just to confirm everything, make sure the book is scheduled. And then to get some context on that call, what we're gonna stop by doing is just recapping what we spoke about on this one, then we'll go into the actual proposal. We'll walk through a ton of case studies then our exact process and then all the additional details like pricing, how to get started.
Speaker 1: Yeah. K. Yeah. Amazing, Ethan. That's it. I'm good for it, man. Same time tomorrow. Send me that stuff and we'll connect tomorrow.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent Terrence. It was an absolute pleasure speaking today. I'm glad we get this scheduled, and I will talk to you tomorrow.
Speaker 1: K. Sounds good. Looking forward to then
Speaker 0: to
