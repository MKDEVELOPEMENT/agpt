Speaker 0:  Perfect. Nick,
Speaker 1: are you? Doing good. How are you?
Speaker 0: Excellent. How's your weekend so far?
Speaker 1: It's good. It was good. Just get back from Norway. Mhmm. And yeah. No. I'm just gonna I get back to work now. What do I use?
Speaker 0: Great week so far. Lot of calls like these. I like these calls a lot, so I can't complain.
Speaker 1: Where where are you located?
Speaker 0: Cape Town.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Cool. And what what time is it there right now?
Speaker 0: Eleven o'clock.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Is it only an hour ahead of me? It's only an hour ahead of ten o'clock.
Speaker 0: Oh, if you might be wondering about the no video thing. I usually do this. It just allows people to focus more on what's being said than checking their hair and stuff. But by all means, you wanna keep yours on? No problem.
Speaker 1: Sure. I can just trim it off. People always say that that the case is focused, but I don't understand that. But All good.
Speaker 0: So so if you're ready, we can get straight into it if you like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Let's do it.
Speaker 0: Cool. So how these calls usually go is? I just wanna ask you some questions about your business, where you are, and where you wanna be. Then if it sounds like we'll be a good fit, I'll explain the service and how it works. Then at the end, you can make a easy decision of whether you wanna be a part of it or not. That'll go with you. Cool. Cool. So, Nick, tell me what motivated you to take this quarter?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Good question. It's just because I have been well, I guess, I could tell you the whole spiel. Basically, yeah, I've had my company for I've been working on a full time for, like, eight months or something like that. Nothing too crazy. I've done everything has been done by myself. Sales. I don't get a service delivery. I have people that work for me that does the actual service delivery for my clients. But the whole sourcing and, you know, reaching other companies closing closing new new clients. Everything is done by me. And, basically, I'm always hoping to hearing a little bit about how so I can help me do that. So I have to do everything by myself. The whole part that I hate is, you know, the the cold outreach. I'm right around there just I'd love, you know, having an initial meeting with clients and you know, closing, obviously. But I just don't have time to continue to feed my company right now because I've so focused on other stuff as well. A part owner and other company. So I'm kinda stuck between, you know, not having enough time to do outreach myself, but I still want new clients. Basically.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Perfect. Am I right in saying that you offer paid advertising?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. The the paid advertising, Facebook ads, take the ads, snap ten ads, and it's all to e commerce businesses or or apps, actually.
Speaker 0: Cool. And how do you price your services?
Speaker 1: At the moment, it's either just, like, a month either just a monthly retainer or a monthly retainer plus. A percentage of ad profits or of ad spend.
Speaker 0: That's cool. On average, what's the value of the retainer?
Speaker 1: On average, that's a good question. It's very different. I would say on average, probably, like, twelve hundred with US. Well, it's very different. I have some paying. Twenty two hundred. I have one paying nine thousand. I have one paying. It's different.
Speaker 0: Yeah. It's a large variable. Cool. So who is your actual ideal customer?
Speaker 1: It is e commerce businesses. I'm not sure if you're familiar with e com e commerce, but e commerce customers who, obviously, sell stuff from the website also customers or clients or companies that I know aren't starting from scratch. Like, for example, you would be able to tell pretty quick if I if I if I if I company, you know, has done any advertiser or not. You can see, you know, how the followers have Instagram, someone who is not too small. I don't wanna work with them anymore. And it's just someone who is willing to invest in in in advertising, basically.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Most of the owners I speak with, they want brands with more significant marketing budgets just so they can spend on the actual heads Is that the same?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Speaker 0: Yeah. And any specific niche that you work with?
Speaker 1: Clothing, I would say, men's and women's clothing. And that's probably where most of my my my clients are are from men's women's clothing and just fashion in general. I don't know. It's a bit broader, but yeah.
Speaker 0: And can you tell me about your sales process?
Speaker 1: Yeah. So my sales process, basically, at the moment, is I do like I said, I do everything my outreach comes either from LinkedIn or people come to me. You just recommendations or or Upwork, different stuff like that, really. And then, usually, what I usually what I do is I yeah. Hop on a quick meeting with them, doing exactly what we're doing now, ask a bunch of discovery questions, get to know the business a bit, and then it's usually just a one call sometimes too cold, but you can tell pretty quick if someone's interested or not. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Cool. Sounds good. Do you know your closing percentage?
Speaker 1: I would say, like, if I have if I book meetings with people and actually, you know, they up the meeting. In the interset, I closed probably one out of three. Well, I don't have enough meetings.
Speaker 0: I see. Yeah. So besides LinkedIn and clients coming to you, how do you come to get customers?
Speaker 1: How I how I contact them?
Speaker 0: Yeah. What's your outreach methods?
Speaker 1: Like I said, there's Upwork. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Upwork. Like I said, that's a website, basically, through there, applying their bunch of jobs to there. And that's basically it. Like, I don't have much more than that. I I did do I've I've done a lot of cold calling in my days, but I haven't done that for a while. Just because I hate her so much.
Speaker 0: I get there all the time for her.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Cool. So Do you so I guess you don't have a system for getting customers on demand right now?
Speaker 1: No. Like, I don't have a system for, like, as it's not ironed out. It's, like, all over the place. Some days
Speaker 0: -- Yeah. --
Speaker 1: when I have time, I do outreach. Other days, I don't. And then it's it's, like, it it's all over the place. Need structure.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So now I just wanna understand exactly where you are and exactly where you where you wanna be with a metric. So much money are you currently making per month for this business?
Speaker 1: This month, I'm gonna make I'm not sure if you speak US dollars, but I'm just gonna give you
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: You're gonna make this month. I'm gonna make let me just do the conversion here. This month, we're gonna probably make around fifteen thousand US dollars
Speaker 0: Cool. And then twelve months time, what's the goal?
Speaker 1: Twelve months time, I wanna be I wanna be up. I know it's ambitious, but I wanna be forty, fifty k per month and consistently.
Speaker 0: My favorite answer is all the ambitious ones.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Twenty first.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Cool. What's your motivation?
Speaker 1: My motivation is just that I love what I do. I love working for myself, and I love making money. That's pretty cool yet.
Speaker 0: Cool. Not fair enough. And how would the business change if we got to forty to fifty k a month?
Speaker 1: I would be able to use more money on what my goal my goal is to is to make enough money to obviously, it's not really the money, like, I need to make a lot of money. No. The the goal is to have that I could that I could invest in in advertising myself. So I'm gonna be running, you know, funnel campaigns for myself to get more customers on on autopilot as well as having processes with call outreach. So I process where my goal is to be able to have capital to invest into my own marketing for myself.
Speaker 0: Yeah. A lot of it's going to reinvest it. Yeah. You're currently making fifteen thousand. You wanna get to around forty to fifty k. What do you think stopping you from getting there?
Speaker 1: Time people and not being yeah. Not enough processes. And I've only been going for eight months, so I've learned to shit time in the last bit. Basically, having the time to do outreach, having a constant flow of meetings, and having processes in place with with my with my cold outreach and management of time, basically. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. So currently at fifteen k, by a lot of people's measures. That's pretty good. Why not just how we were?
Speaker 1: I don't really I don't know. Like, I just I don't I don't know why I'll just say why I'm inside. I know I I know I can do a lot better. I know I know how to sell. I know how to sell our services and how to talk to people. So I don't see any reason why I can't push this to being a long word in that.
Speaker 0: Excellent. And when are you looking to solve this problem?
Speaker 1: Yeah. ASAP. Exactly what you want to hear probably.
Speaker 0: Well, based on your answers, I have a lot of confidence that I can definitely help you with this. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what we do?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty curious to hear what you do and how you do it.
Speaker 0: Excellent. So in short, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get more clients by automating their client acquisition and filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agencies that we work with are making between ten and thirty thousand dollars per month with the goal of getting to around forty to sixty thousand dollars per month. Typically, these owners are doing everything in the business themselves from sales to outreach, and they're just lacking a lot of time. They're also lacking systems to get clients, you know, on autopilot when they want. So we help them to automate and customize a client acquisition and to take more of an ownership role in their business. We have them to move from working in the business to working on the business. So in conclusion based on what you said, it seems like you're a phenomenal fit for what we do.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. For sure. How do you guys do it though? Like, what's your processes when it comes to? Know, feeling every calendar is that kind of thing. Like, what do you guys in this process? Is who does it? How do you do it? Yeah.
Speaker 0: So Yeah. I'll I'll just give a a full overview of the entire process. Is that alright with you?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Cool for it.
Speaker 0: Cool. So to start, our service was created with one goal in mind to help you to get more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings with prospects in huge needed services. So we'll start by creating a new offer and designing unique messaging that will stand out from all the other agencies and attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll utilize this messaging in highly personalized outreach campaigns where we will target and book meetings with the most qualified prospects Plus, it's completely organic meaning you don't have to risk any money on ads or anything like that. In addition to this, the entire process start to finishes one hundred percent done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up the calls with prospects in huge need of your services. And solve them on that. So the entire service was designed for owners looking to breakthrough automated outreach and get to around forty to sixty thousand dollars per month. Mhmm.
Speaker 1: Okay. That does sounds great. Like so you mentioned on LinkedIn, obviously, you pay for results, that kind of thing, which is great. When it comes to your like, does it is it, like, you know, you do cold calling and email outreach or what, like, works best for you for you? Or do you have a team or what?
Speaker 0: Yeah. We have a team and our methods include cold email and LinkedIn outreach.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Got it. And is that done through, like, through my LinkedIn profile? Or how does that work?
Speaker 0: For the email, we'll create a separate one. This just keeps this just helps to keep everything organized and to protect your email from potentially anything. And in addition to this, we would use your LinkedIn account.
Speaker 1: Got it. Got it. Okay. That's fine. Cool. And that's awesome. And that what like, I I assume you've worked with, you know, other marketing agencies. Right?
Speaker 0: Yeah. All of them are marketing entities.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay. And and, like, what's your experience with, like, e commerce businesses and stuff like that? Like, are they pretty easy I could reach out to?
Speaker 0: Yeah. I don't know if I've mentioned this, but all the clients who we work with target e com brands.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I know. You definitely did mention that, but that's great. Cool. And, like, how does it work? Like, obviously, you actually pay for, like, for results. What's, like, the what's the rates? How does it work with charging? And yeah.
Speaker 0: Yes. I'll just give the entire pricing overview. Is that okay with you? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Aphi for building and managing this entire system is a one time setup we have three thousand dollars. And from there, it's only one hundred dollars per appointment. But What we found after doing this for a lot of agencies and for very long time is that the people make decisions quickly always turn out to the best clients and we get them the best results because of that. So for those reasons, we have something called incentive based pricing where if you can make the decision today, I'll cut the setup in half and then it's just a one time setup of one thousand five hundred dollars and one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what does that setup fee include? Like, what setup like, how does that work?
Speaker 0: So there's a couple of things that it goes into. One is the team members, obviously. The people managing your account, the people sourcing the leads. Then it's for every account that we have additional software costs incurred because of that So it'll mostly go to sourcing a leads, setting up the entire systems where we'll send emails from, warming up your account, things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. Cool. And how often or, like, how long does it usually take for you to, you know, see results?
Speaker 0: Sure. So in I'm not sure if you saw on the LinkedIn, but we say we guarantee fifteen to thirty five meetings per month. To get up to that point, It takes usually, it takes around sixty to ninety days to scale up the outreach to that point.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: However, that's not to say you're not gonna see results in the first month. It just won't be that level from the start. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. That's fine. And how does it work? Like, how does it get a meeting with someone that's amazing? Like, what if let's say the person who doesn't show up to the meeting, he can't get in touch I go. I'm still entitled to pay for a meeting like that or how does that work?
Speaker 0: No. I wouldn't. We would never charge for someone that doesn't show up. Don't think that's fair.
Speaker 1: Okay. So what do I like, what's, like, considered, like, a qualified meeting in your eyes then? So But no.
Speaker 0: Yeah. When we get set up, I'm gonna ask you your criteria on the leads you're looking for exactly. Who want us to target. And based on those numbers, we'll set up some parameters to determine the qualification process. For example, monthly revenue. It's a common one we've used. Social media following another one. So based on those criteria, and if they show up, that would would determine whether it's qualified or not.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Cool. Like, that sounds pretty safe to be honest. No. That's cool. I'm I'm definitely down. What I can do is have a meeting with my calendar in in ten minutes. But what I can do is how does it work to get started? Like, if you pay everything upfront or, like, can you split it up? Or how does it work?
Speaker 0: Most of them are paid upfront. However, if you need it, we can split up the payment into two months of the settlement. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, like, you you do have and then yeah. Okay. That makes good sense. Cool. That sounds great. Let me cool. Well, I'm definitely down for this. This seems pretty cool. I guess the only thing that I wanna ask is, like, do you send notes, like, an agreement or, like, how does it work?
Speaker 0: Yeah. After the payment is made, I'll send you the onboarding link that will get you into the Slack. And then from there, I'll send you a fully written out contract that we'll talk about, discuss. Yeah. Everything will be in Okay. Yeah. Everything will be affected.
Speaker 1: Should I do? Should I do the contract before payment though?
Speaker 0: We typically don't do it that way, but if if it's needed. Yeah. Worst case scenario
Speaker 1: That'd be great.
Speaker 0: If we if we don't agree, on something in the contract, we could always refund you. It's never happened before, but, I mean, it's a possibility. Because it takes it takes us to write out the contract for every person. So we don't like the delay on getting started. Because if you pay now, then we can get you onboarding everything in a lot faster time than waiting for the contract, if you know what I mean.
Speaker 1: Okay. Is there, like, a is there, like, a binding period?
Speaker 0: What do you mean by that?
Speaker 1: Like, is my like, if we were to work together, is it, like, you know, we're, like, blinded, like, on the contract for, like, a couple months? Or, like, is it just month to month? Or out of the work?
Speaker 0: Yeah. It's month on month. There's no official binding. However we go for could you explain what you mean specifically?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Like, I just mean, like, if I sign a new client, it's like I'd say, like, the period is for a minimum of three months. You can't cancel before three months kind of thing. Is that the same for you? Or how do you do it?
Speaker 0: Yeah. We do it usually. If no results are seen and the client wants to cancel, we do three months of minimum outreach, the ninety days that we talk about. Yeah. It's in the contract, but it's never happened before. So I can't really give a good answer. But, yeah, we go for just ninety days.
Speaker 1: Okay. Cool. Well, Cool. Yeah. If you could send me over that that that invoice, then I'll get I'll get that paid. I would love to get started. And that would be great if we could do that half and half just to start off with.
Speaker 0: That's perfect. So that'll be seven hundred and fifty now and then seven fifty in the next month.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: That's perfect. Exactly. Sure. I can send it now if you'd like?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Can you do that? Sure. I've got a hop on. I got a call with my with my my team before I hop on a call with my accountant. So I'm gonna I'm gonna hop off. But he if you'd said that's even gonna be great.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Perfect.
Speaker 1: Cool. Well, it's great meeting you, and I guess it'll be a Dutch.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. Absolutely. M b k media dot net. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Excellent. It's great meeting you. Really excited
Speaker 1: to work with you.
Speaker 0: Together. Yeah. I think it's gonna be amazing.
Speaker 1: Me too. You too, man. Thank you.
Speaker 0: See you, man.
