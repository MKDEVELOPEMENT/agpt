Speaker 0:  Darren's.
Speaker 1: How are you doing?
Speaker 0: Doing excellent, man. How are you?
Speaker 1: Good. Good. Just, you know, just working. Went through meetings and stuff and stuff. Probably you.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Same thing same thing. And stuff. Yeah. You might not like what I'm about to
Speaker 2: say on this call.
Speaker 0: So I have to preface it with that. But the thing that I do wanna speak about is the fact that we just signed up two or three clients was in the last few hours. So pretty much reaching capacity at this point. Right.
Speaker 2: There's a few things that I wanna speak about before I present any sort of proposal if we do that. And it's just to make sure that we're actually the best fit for you.
Speaker 0: Because the last thing I
Speaker 2: want is for, you know, a bad experience for you. So -- Yep.
Speaker 0: -- if you don't mind, can I just ask some more questions on your current situation and then I can share what I'd recommend?
Speaker 1: Sure.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. So in terms of your case studies, I know you mentioned that in all your past results, you work with medium sized companies, homebuilders, law firms, publishing companies, coaches, events, planners. That's correct. Right? Yeah. Cool. And in terms of the results that you're able to generate for them, do you have any sort of case studies or direct outcomes that you helped them to generate?
Speaker 1: Of course.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Do you have an idea of what some of those are just as examples?
Speaker 1: In regards to which which which part? Like, where does it matter?
Speaker 0: No. Pretty much is your best case studies. What were the outcomes that you're able to generate for them?
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. I guess you could say it goes anywhere from KPIs from traffic to lead generation to social growth itself. Engagement growth, like all of those aspects as well.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Cool. So the key metrics that
Speaker 2: you track are engagement.
Speaker 3: Brokerage. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Broker conversions.
Speaker 0: That's a combined that's perfect. Okay. And just out of curiosity, are you able would you have these case studies available, you know, to share?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Of course. We utilize them. That's how we get clients.
Speaker 0: K. Cool.
Speaker 1: We get clients with proposals. We have content portfolio. In regards to different means and different content brands. And then we have case studies in regards to it, anything from copywriting, blog writing. It's all organized and we shared with clients to get clients.
Speaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. Last thing, would you be able to share this with me?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. Are you do you have it on add?
Speaker 1: No. I don't have it right now. I'd have to get someone to send it to you.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. Yep. Because, again, I wanna just be fully transparent. We are very near capacity. And this is something weird sales tactic, by the way. So we're actually nearing capacity. And we have room for a few more clients, but we purely wanna base it off of who has the best results that we can actually leverage. Yeah. So because of that, Like I said at the beginning, I think you won't like what I'm saying, but I won't be able to present the proposal today. And it's fine because I just need to evaluate these resources before we take any sort of action on that.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's fine. But I do need some sort of numbers or something to have an under standing prior to even, I guess, booking even another call if you guys decided to work with us. Right? We're we're both taking time here. So I'm just trying to understanding. That's why I'm hearing.
Speaker 0: No. I totally understand. And I because we we signed them up very recently. And I hate coming onto the calls, not being able to, you know, provide what we wanted to talk about in the first place. So I totally understand what numbers are you looking for specifically?
Speaker 1: In regards to what you guys do, we talked a lot about me, but you didn't talk a lot about you.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Alright. Cool. K. Let me see what I can bring up
Speaker 3: in the meantime because, like I said, want you to actually get something out of this. Alright. Cool.
Speaker 0: Alright. Cool. Okay. You know what? What we can do is I can actually take you through the proposal. Right, that I usually had before this actually happened. And based on that, if you're still interested by
Speaker 2: the end of it, what we
Speaker 0: can do is you can send over the case studies. I can review it,
Speaker 2: and then I can do send the, you know, what an access would be. Would that be okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah. That makes sense.
Speaker 0: Alright. Perfect. Alright. Because this is what the team wrote up right before this happens. So We added already in the meantime. Alright. Cool. Everything clear? Yeah. Alright. Fantastic. So how to add an extra fifty to a hundred k tier agency within sixty nine months by integrating our client acquisition machine? So what I'm gonna share in this very quick call is, firstly, how to customize your client acquisition and agency growth. The three step system on hundred ad mix for fifty hundred thousand per month without ad spend, problems that may be preventing you from, you know, predictably signing clients and putting sales calls. Our exact system outlines that you could do this with or without us, unique lead generation and client acquisition knowledge found through thousands and thousands of split tests, And then how marketing agents is exactly like yours pretty easily at fifty to a hundred k a month within sixty nine months? What to do first and why? And then a bonus at the end, so stick around. So what I'd like to start with is some quick case studies just so you get an idea of who we've helped in the past. And if you're on YouTube, you might know my good friend, Charlie Morgan. Using scale to two point eight will appear, two hundred and thirty five k a month, using only outreach. Right? And the report mention this. I'm actually speaking at his mastermind in the coming weeks, a good friend of mine. And the reason I mention it is because it shows what's possible using purely outreach. Right? No paid acquisition methods, anything to that degree. And these are the exact same methods that we'd implement for you, for ourselves, and for our other clients. Right? We're also working with Ricky Shea Holdings, Kenny Stevens, areas with Russell Brunson. He's running a eight figure holding company, you know, where he invests in e commerce brands. And he also brought us a growth marketing agency. So he partners with, you know, you know, other brands, other e commerce brands, and he helps him grow through paid acquisition. Also work with Frank. He's building eight figure affiliate marketing systems for e commerce brands. And again, I'll go through this quickly because they want us to be a five up on call. Zach, he's running a multi seven figure e commerce growth agency. We're a Chris seven figure e commerce growth agency. Right? John, again, building seven figure outbound systems from our key agencies. Austin, seven hundred and forty k in the pipeline. And what I really wanna emphasize, because, obviously, the numbers are cool. Anyone can just have some nice numbers. But The key point that I wanna mention is the before and after. Right? What you're gonna see is a recurring pattern. These agency owners, they are firstly great at what they do. Right? Because they're growing from referrals. Their clients love what they're offering. They want to see more of it and they're able to sell and they're able to deliver, they just have nobody to sell too. So they tried agents, they tried LinkedIn, they tried email, but not seeing any results from it. So once they start working with us, they're able to add next to twenty four k a month. Two hundred and eighty eight k a year, and he's focused solely on managing his team and, you know, pretty much removed from the operations. Then we've got Geely two hundred and twenty eight k in sales in another thirty days Right? This is sales while training his team. And again, you're seeing the same thing over and over and over. They're growing purely referrals. They're trying to do this themselves. They just wanna get themselves out of the process. And once you do that, two hundred and twenty eight k in under thirty days. Right. Jeff, hundred ninety two k, and again, same thing, same thing, Rasik, all these are marketing agencies focused purely on, you know, conversions, straight ROI, generating sales, generating leads, everything's actually and some of the biggest names in the space as well, keynote, e comm growth, on track, purify all seven figure marketing agencies. Right. So who is this actually for? Because, I mean, at this point, we turned down more agencies than we take on. And it's for established b to b marketing agencies. With existing results and happy clients, like we're saying at the beginning. And agencies who don't have a systematic, predictable method of booking meetings and signing clients who rely on referrals for the growth. And founders and CEOs who have tried email social media outreach by themselves by hiring people working with a legion agency That's still not getting the results that they need. And agencies who have a great service, the systems take on new clients and the ability to sell, but no predictable way of booking the calls with qualified prospects. Right? My founders and CEOs were willing and able to add extra fifty hundred k a month while transitioning from working in the business to working on the business. Right? So, I mean, you can simply add an extra fifty to a hundred k a month by signing more clients. And I know you mentioned your goals to go from forty k to around sixty to a hundred. Which should be pretty straightforward. So what stops most agencies? Right? You can just sign more clients. Why don't we just sign more clients? And it's because They're not speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day. So if we can do this, I mean, scale is inevitable, but there's a problem. Because you as the founder as a CEO, you won't have enough time to do this. Right? Because you're doing everything else. So the only other options you have is one hiring employee that knows high level sales and marketing. But if they know that, they probably have their own business or they cost millions of yen salaries. Or you could hire a legion, you know, agency or freelancer or some guy from Upwork that doesn't really have your best interests at heart. Because they just want to send you some bookings, but you want clients signed. You want revenue generated. You want clients that stay on that you like working. So this is why growth partnering is the only viable option for marketing agencies to really scale because growth partnering combines high level sales and marketing because we do this for ourselves and our clients, plus aligned incentives, meaning we want the same thing. We want you to generate revenue. We want you to sign clients and most importantly, keep the clients for a long, long time. Plus is without costing, you know, millions per year in salaries and we actually guarantee results. So what I'll quickly wanna walk you through are the three steps that I, you know, actually recommend for you to increase your revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within sixty nine months. And Step one is prepare the vessel, set in the foundations for hyper growth. Step two is launching the machine, the client acquisition system, and step three is the ultimate of conversion, turning interest into revenue. So what I have on the left is the old way of doing things and the old outcome. And on the right, the new way and the new outcome. So The old way is what most agencies do, why they, you know, don't get results and on the right, you know, what we recommend. So the old way is collecting case studies through text. So this is messaging your client, asking what results you get. Put it on to a website, and hope it for the best. But the thing is, anyone can just put numbers on a website. Right? So prospects, they don't relate. They because it can be so easily faked. So you put in all this work with your clients to deliver amazing results, which I know you guys do, just for prospects to not be able to relate. Right? The new way of doing things and what we recommend for all of our clients is case study video or video case study interviews. And what does this is either our team members or your team members gets onto a call with your clients and figures out whether they were before working with you, whether they are after working with you, and what you did to bridge that gap And what you get is a highly, highly engaging and incredibly relatable sales asset that you can use before a call, after a call on your website, on your LinkedIn and it's just gonna solve for you on autopilot. Right? Secondly, is using a commodity offer. So the thing is, The biggest problem for multi agencies is that there are so many, and they all offer such similar services, whether that's you know, branding, marketing, or consulting, or PPC, or SEO. And to the prospect, unfortunately, you just look like everyone else. So because of that, you get no interest. So if you've ever struggled to book meetings, to get attention with Outreach, it's because you just look like everyone else. So the new way of doing things is to build an irresistible offer around what you're already doing, which will allow you to be seen as extremely unique to stand out, to book more meetings, to increase a close percentage, while also raising your prices and increasing the likelihood that prospects will want to stay on board with you. Right? And step three is node profile social proof. So it's the equivalent of looking like everyone else. If you do ARPC from LinkedIn, from your website, for example. And, you know, there's nothing there. It's not established. You're just gonna get no interest, like, you know, having the same offer. So so you're doing a great job on LinkedIn where you're posting content. Correct?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have someone posting content. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So you you already started on this because you definitely understand the value in this. So you're posting the content, positioning yourself as an expert, which you are. And this will allow you to generate inbound leads, generate high interest, and pre sell prospects before the call. And we can actually leverage any sort of outreach that or any sort of content that you create in the outreach. And that's just if I could force multiply on everything. Right? And step two is obviously relying on referrals in the mind. And as we know, it's unpredictable, it's sporadic, keeps on its anxiety, and it forces you to have to work with anyone that comes to you because, you know, we need cash flow. Right? And it's totally understandable. So the new way is multi account and multi domain LinkedIn and email outreach with a dedicated sales team that will be able to convert replies into bookings. Right? Mhmm. And just to go a bit deeper into this, the reason we do multi account and multi domain is because when we find something that works, when we find something that guess you to sixty k, a hundred k, and you decide, hey, Ethan, this is great, but I wanna go to two hundred. I wanna go to three hundred. I wanna remove myself completely. It's just a matter of doing more of what's already working. Mhmm. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We don't have to do some crazy TikTok UGC strategy to get your clients. We literally just have to duplicate what's already working, and what that is, is more domains and more accounts, which will allow you to generate more bookings and more sales. Like we're saying in the last one, it's just the numbers game. So on top of that, we'll provide, you know, we'll hire, manage, train a dedicated sales team that does all this work for you. So they'll manage the replies, get them on to calls with you, and all you need to do is get on the calls and solve them. Right? And I definitely think you'll be able to do that. So and again, the new way the new outcome is systematic, predictable growth, and you choose exactly who you want to work with. Right? You set the qualification criteria. And again, it's incredibly incredibly scalable. And finally step three, this is the conversion system. So the old way, again, is having no brand presence. Right? It's having no website, no LinkedIn profile, no Instagram, nothing. And what it causes a lack of trust, difficulty selling, they don't know who you are. So like you're doing already, a great job with it, is leveraging your brand, your personal brand on LinkedIn, but also the media. That we can get through the video case studies. So prospects can see this before a call, and you're not doing any extra work. But you're selling them because they're watching your stuff. So it boils trust and allows you to sell on autopilot. Secondly, speaking to unqualified prospects, so You know, the worst thing ever is wasting hours towards people aren't even interested in what you do and that don't even know who you are because your time is obviously more valuable than anyone else in the company just out of the fact that you're, you know, the founder. So what we wanna do is pre sell prospects before the calls so that they know who you are. They know what you do. And it'll increase a closed percentage. And then finally, most agency owners, they might be at a hundred k, two hundred k, but they still just have no sales process. Right? And you feel like you're constantly guessing what to say. They just get on to calls. They ask some questions across the fingers and, you know, hope hope they pay. Right? So the new way is to provide a fully optimized sales process based on our eight figure clients that you can just copy and paste into your business. And what we also provide is weekly evaluation, core reviews just to make sure you're closing as many deals as possible. And, you know, the goal is really to turn you into and even better closer than what you are now, just by evaluating your calls, watching them over, and then giving you feedback. Mhmm.
Speaker 1: But
Speaker 0: so in summary, this is our system to increase in revenue by fifty to hundred k a month. And at this point, when you have three options, really, you can continue what you're currently doing, not really having a predictable way, you know, to sign clients, to remove yourself from the process, option two, you could work with, I don't know, a lead gen freelancer that doesn't have your best interest at heart. But most likely, unfortunately, won't deliver. And option three, you could partner with us because we've done this so many times, have the high level skills of a farmer k plus employee, and genuinely have your best interest ever. Right? So remember Daniel also launched King Price, all the other cases that he's from before, and the ones that he even mentioned, they started the agencies to help people make money, and they worked so hard to deliver an amazing service, make their clients happy and put the systems in place to grow. But now they had the service, but nobody to sell the service to. So booking meetings and signing clients became the bottleneck. So they tried all these outreach methods, but they still can achieve the predictable growth that they needed. And because they didn't have that predictable growth, they couldn't remove themselves. They couldn't systemize anything. So they didn't have the client acquisition system. We help them to build out a brand new offer, foundational assets, launch the campaigns, pre sell prospects and continually improve to be able to add twenty, fifty, one hundred k MOS to the revenue. So now at this point, they're pretty much removed from client acquisition. They have the time to do anything they want to can focus on being a business owner and managing the team's all the business signs clients on autopilot. Right? So one of the last things is some of the outcomes that work with us is that you'll be able predictably booked meetings and signed clients using proven scalable systems. You can pretty comfortably add an extra fifty hundred k mark to your agency within six or nine months. And I know your goal is to go from forty to sixty to a hundred. You know, if we're just looking at that 20k gap, it should be pretty straightforward. Finally stop worrying about when you sign your next client and bring you predictable cash flow. You can forget about working with these nightmare clients and have complete choice of who you want to work with. And you'll just feel calm and confident knowing that the acquisition side of your business will always be taken care of and ran by the numbers. Right? There's no guesswork at all. So the last thing is a quick implementation plan on exactly how long things will take to actually get going, what you can expect, and how everything works. So phase one. Right? And it's the typical time frame is two, three weeks. And, honestly, it will take between ten to fourteen days realistically. But, you know, we'd like to be conservative. But it's usually ten to fourteen days. And what this includes is the entire setup period. Right? Every single thing that we need to do before we launch is done in this small period already. So collecting the case studies, building new offer, optimizing everything, and creating the campaigns. Right? Everything is taken care of here, and it's extremely efficient. And as soon as this is done, we look. Right? So up on campaigns are going on email, on LinkedIn, And again, what this is is just the process of reaching out to prospects, getting them onto your calendar so that all you need to do is sell them. And hypothetically, you know, if messages are going out, bookings can come in. Right? And if bookings are coming in, sales can demand. And finally, the conversion system, and again, this is straight after phase one. So as soon as everything's set up, this is implemented just to make sure you are closing as many deals as humanly possible. And yeah. So I've spent a long time. Hopefully, I wasn't on mute to move. Do you have any questions? No. You're good.
Speaker 1: No. That's that's definitely yeah. I was that's good. Right? I'll let you know too. I don't think I ever told Jude. I don't know if you know them scaling with systems, Ravi.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I did his back end. I was doing his back end with his VAs and stuff. I did that even though it's seventeen months, but then it was too much work as me as running my business. I had to depart from there. But I worked with them for quite some time. So I understand all of this. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Oh, that's great.
Speaker 1: Yeah. No. That's good. But what I'm what I'm curious about is, like, what is your implementation in regards to pricing? Right? Yeah. For you guys.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That's the good stuff. So obviously, that'll come after in the next three slides. That'll come just wanna make sure everything's clear on the actual process. Is anything unclear at all? Do you have any questions on this?
Speaker 1: Not at all. I did see that you you mentioned LinkedIn outbound. Do you guys use, like, a like, is it, like, automated message drip campaigns you guys utilize?
Speaker 0: We do, if that's the best option. Yes.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah. I've used that for clients as well too, it's very effective.
Speaker 0: Nice.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Cool. Anything else?
Speaker 1: No. I just wanna get down to the new ingredient to see what you guys cost and then get you guys what you need if it's worth it and that's it.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Alright. That's amazing. So you work for Robbie's team.
Speaker 1: Yeah?
Speaker 0: Oh, that's
Speaker 1: I was yeah, man. Those videos you're seeing on YouTube, man. I had to period all those, man.
Speaker 0: Wow. That's it. We
Speaker 1: were gonna work with this team in Scottsdale. I did that for quite some time. I think my last episode I did was the one we're there in New York going over Ryan's office. Might have been the last one. But, yeah, I did that for quite some time.
Speaker 0: That's amazing. Alright.
Speaker 1: It's just really demanding. Right? Like, they're very, very busy. So it's like, I it was demanding of my time. It was like a ten hour day gig. And that's when I was first starting out more not first starting out, but, like, what I was just starting to grow. And then I got to the point where I had to make a decision and what I was doing because the retainer I was with them was wasn't worth it because when I was making more of my business.
Speaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. Yeah. And we can get into the good stuff. So -- Yeah. -- what I'd like to start with is a quick r of our calculator just because the last thing that I want is an emotional decision. And to give some numbers on what we expect, if we were to see fifteen to twenty five bookings a month. Okay? And you've only closed at twenty percent, but the industry average is around thirty percent based on our clients, I know you mentioned in the last call that you are closing at twenty, so I chose to go with that one. Yep. And let's say, we're only charging a three k return. And we recommend all of our clients charge at least, you know, five k, seven k. But, again, we'll go with conservative numbers. So If you were to only close at twenty percent and you only charge three k a month, you would sign on average three to five new clients every single month. But and using ADMAS, you would generate an extra nine to fifteen thousand in additional monthly revenue month on month. Now, obviously, churn is a real thing. But let's just do that for now. So if this was the case, you would generate an extra nine to fifteen thousand every single month. And let's say that happened for nine months. At the end of that period, you would have generated an extra one hundred and eight to one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars in additional monthly revenue at the end of the nine months. But this is an extra one point three to one point six million per year. Right? And the thing is, We're not telling you to close at a hundred and twelve percent. We're not telling you to charge a hundred and ten thousand per month. It's using pretty straightforward math. Right? So that's whenever I say go from forty k to sixty or a hundred is not overly complex or overly difficult. This is why I say that, just because the math is on your side. K? Yeah. So on top of this, on top of the numbers making sense, What we also do is that we guarantee that within six to nine months, we'll reach our revenue target of helping you add an extra fifty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars per month right, in recurrent with you. And if not, myself, my cofounder, your account manager, the sales manager, and all the reps will work completely free until you hit this outcome. So either way, you're not just guaranteed to make your money back. You're not just guaranteed to make an ROI. You're guaranteed to make a huge return on your investment. Because the way we like to think about things is if you're not making ten times what you're paying us at least, then we've done something very very wrong. Right? So to get into the good stuff, what I have on the left at the top is, you know, if you were to get every single component of our offer, individually from a vendor, from a consultant, from an agency, and the individual costs. So for example, the foundational agency offer creation, niche research, messaging three k, you know, getting case study videos created, edited, formatted every single month, plus the sales assets, two point one per month, and outbound LinkedIn team created and managed two, three, Outbound email team, three thousand eight hundred, end to end sales process creation, you know, optimization every single week, three thousand nine hundred plus two k per month, And then all the software, all the SOPs, all the people templates, and the hiring that we do on behalf of, you know, the company, three point six. And finally, the way we structure the pricing is we have two options. Option one is seven thousand eight hundred for nine months and option two is four thousand nine hundred plus nine percent of the first month retainer of clients that you sign using our services.
Speaker 1: So it's only so you have to charge me seventy eight hundred And that's for the complete nine months?
Speaker 2: No. It's seventy nine seventy eight hundred for nine months.
Speaker 0: Per month?
Speaker 3: Per month. Correct.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. And then forty nine hundred plus nine percent revenue growth regards to what clients we're bringing in?
Speaker 0: Absolutely. So it's just the clients that you sign using our services, we just take nine percent off of month to month.
Speaker 1: Only one time. Yep. Interesting. Okay. Okay. That sounds too bad.
Speaker 0: Glad to hear
Speaker 1: that. Sweet? Okay. So I guess I'll get collateral together for you in regards to,
Speaker 0: you
Speaker 1: know, case studies, like, work we've done. And stuff like that, and you can evaluate it. If you guys have room for what's going on,
Speaker 3: that'll be perfect. That'll be perfect. So just wanna make sure. Oh, do you
Speaker 0: wanna see the numbers then?
Speaker 1: No. You're good. I just
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. And I'll obviously send all the notes to you.
Speaker 1: Off as we
Speaker 0: yeah. And the deck as well. I just wanna make sure do you have any questions on the process?
Speaker 1: No. Like I said, I understand this process and that was why I reached out to you because, like I said, I've I've seen these engines in action. Right? It's just me implementing them and trying to do this right now myself is just not possible. So I do know the potential. Right? Like, I watched Robyn scale from you know what I mean? Yeah. Just under a million a month to two, three, four million, five million, six million, ten million a month. You know what I mean? I know it works. Right? So Okay. Cool. No. I'll get you that stuff. Maybe give me until tomorrow, like, the end of the week, right tomorrow. And then I guess I'll I'll look over again what you share with me. I also have notes here too with my order. I'll go back through and with my team. And then we'll see if you guys feel you guys fit and we could do this or what's going on?
Speaker 0: Look, I'll be honest, out of everyone that's I mean, I have a few more calls. I mean, this week. But out of everyone, I'm more confident in you than anyone else that I've been speaking to.
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 0: Generally -- Okay. -- it's because of I mean, I like you as a person too, but besides that, just based on what you've been saying to of the systems that you have -- Yes. -- based on the way you think the clarity in which you think, having the systems, having the sales process being, like, analytical in terms of knowing the numbers that's required. James will do incredibly well. Based on that, I mean, we could honestly get, you know, they're moving as soon as possible. If you're able to send something over, even it doesn't even have
Speaker 2: to be some crazy, like, nice PDF case study Dick.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I know. I'm I was just gonna honestly, I'll probably send you a Google Drive that you can shift through with a whole bunch of, like, work we've done with clients and stuff. So you can see the quality we do provide. And I mean, like, yeah, it's a lot. There's a lot in there.
Speaker 0: Perfect. That's perfect.
Speaker 1: We just gotta organize it and make it look nice and be able to, you know, and testimonials from my clients. That's easy for me to get, man. Have a really good relationship with at least, like, sixty, seventy percent of them were, you know so I feel I feel like, you know, it makes sense to me. I know you know what I mean in regards to it, that's that's that's investments, you know, in the first few months would be paid back by the time we reach the third. So in in my head so in my head, it makes sense. Right? And it's better than me going and spending, you know what I mean, seven k on ads on Google. And hoping for the best. You know what I mean? So I understand that. And then me even doing something as simple as, like, a link solution and LinkedIn outreach. You know what I mean? Like, I know the cost of all those things, but I also know the cost of managing that stuff. Mhmm. And to make sure it's, you know, it's right. So to be completely hands off, And if there's a turnaround in three months, you know what I mean? Even for me, right, taking that, you know, twenty thousand dollars, putting it aside, and say, okay. Like, we we should be able to at least be breaking even by that second month or getting close to it in regards to that ROI. I think we'd have a clear vision that way. So I I I understand it completely broke.
Speaker 2: Absolutely. Yeah. And again, like I said on
Speaker 0: the last one, you have this awareness that so many business owners lack.
Speaker 1: Right.
Speaker 2: That's the person. The way I like to look at it is I mean, if you're charging on a monthly recurring basis, you need what? Two clients?
Speaker 0: Yeah. I think that's what
Speaker 1: that's what I mean. Right? So yeah.
Speaker 0: Because it's it's not you sign the client and then you have to sign two more. You have to sign two more. It's like you sign the two. And if they stay on, you're literally cash flow positive for the entire period. Yeah. Like, it signed two clients and keep them
Speaker 2: on for nine months and you pay for our services and you're making a profit in a entire way. Like
Speaker 0: -- Yeah. -- try to structure it
Speaker 2: in that way where you can make an ROI extremely simply. Okay. Then based on that, because honestly, all we're looking for is we've helped and the outcomes.
Speaker 0: And if the outcomes can be as tailored towards revenue generated or conversions, that'll be the absolute best that we can get. We don't need pictures. We don't need any of this stuff, like, we just need to and if that's the case, I'd be happy
Speaker 2: to schedule a follow-up call tomorrow. Where we can pretty much finalize everything you could need if you're free at the same time or a different time tomorrow.
Speaker 1: Let's see. Tomorrow. What time is it again? One? I should be
Speaker 0: good. Sent up?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Same time.
Speaker 0: Three days in a row.
Speaker 1: That's okay.
Speaker 0: Alright. That's amazing. Do you have any other questions for me? Happy to answer anything that you might have now?
Speaker 1: No. Not at all. I wanna really just review what you have going on and, like, what you we just went over. Yeah. And that's really it, man. I think another conversation would be good. And and what we can do and see if we lock this in.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent. That'll be amazing. Alright. Perfect. So what I'll do is send the invites straight off of this call. And what I'll also do is I'll send the entire presentation. You'll get everything that we spoke about. I'll send
Speaker 1: those in
Speaker 0: email and by LinkedIn as well, probably. And then, yep, I'll schedule the event and we can talk to him on.
Speaker 1: K. Amazing. Sounds good, man. I appreciate it.
Speaker 0: Alright. Your legend. Great to begin the call, and I will talk to you soon. See if
