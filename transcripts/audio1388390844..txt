Speaker 0:  This in the mic. Josh from man. How are you?
Speaker 1: A pro. How are
Speaker 0: you? Excellent. Yep. Am
Speaker 1: I bad. Am I bad?
Speaker 0: Perfect. How's your weekend so far?
Speaker 1: Good, bro. Busy. Busy. Your son visit? Excellent.
Speaker 0: Lot of calls like this, and I like these calls, so great week to say the least.
Speaker 1: The street over there.
Speaker 0: Cool. So if you're ready, we can get
Speaker 1: right into it. Let's store it, man. Let's store it.
Speaker 0: Perfect. So how these calls usually go is. I just wanna ask you some questions about you and your business, where you are, where you wanna be. Then if it sounds like you're a good fit, I'll explain our service and how it works. Then at the end, it's a simple decision whether you want to be a part of it or not. That'll go with you. Yeah, man. Suresh. Yep. Perfect. So Josh, tell tell me what motivated you to take this call today.
Speaker 1: So we're trying to scale. Basically, we're at, like, decent enough revenue at the moment. We've got good claims. Well, we're just trying to kind of transition out of having a small lower paying claims move towards more higher ticket claims and kind of shooting for quality over quantity as such. So, like, I kinda don't really have time to do the outreach process myself. So I wanted to kinda touch base with you, obviously, to see. Is it something, you know, would it be a good fit? Can we work something out? Can we get highly qualified leads into the pipeline that are, you know, have good intent to play? Unless those that are willing to be sold too, essentially.
Speaker 0: Excellent. Am I right in saying that you sell email and SMS marketing?
Speaker 1: That is correct. Yep. Yes.
Speaker 0: So what do you charge for these services?
Speaker 1: It's highly dependent on the clients, but usually, probably, anywhere from, you know, nine hundred to fifteen hundred.
Speaker 0: Dollars or pounds?
Speaker 1: That would be euros.
Speaker 0: Euros. Cool. Yeah. And on average, how long does the client stay on board with you?
Speaker 1: I have a very good retention rate, so most clients stay on six months plus. So it's very much long term. It's not, like, you know, just in short term, fucking flip them, get them in and and seems really can shoot for kind of long term growth. So as if you if the client grows, you grow alongside it. Mainly focused on, let's say, like, anybody that's doing fifty k plus a month and bringing all those goes to, you know, like, let's say, a hundred and fifty k a month and really scaling that over the business. I don't really look at anybody who's, like, ideally, the sweet spot will be around a fifty k mark. We do take on clients. We've got a couple of clients that are doing, like, you know, twenty seventeen to twenty k a month, but, like, I don't touch anything under, like, anything under fifteen. Really? It's just for compliant list. So, yeah, man.
Speaker 0: Cool. So what does your ideal client look like? Besides the revenue?
Speaker 1: Yeah. My ID ID client will be someone obviously on shop before your woofcommerce, which is a key for me to be able to perform. Someone who's actually willing to trust in this process. In terms of niche, I'm pretty open to niche. I work across fitness. A lot of claims for fitness I work across. Obviously, just connect generic e com, hair care, or makeup. So ideally, like, yeah, anything within, I suppose, that space, like, it doesn't matter if it's low ticket, high ticket. I work with Like, currently, we've got, like, twenty two clients that are, you know, across a number of different sectors. So we're pretty open. Ideal thing would be, obviously, if if I was gonna choose. Fashion cosmetics or fitness, essentially, on Shopify or e commerce doing decent revenue. You know, a good creative team. I kind of have a small bit of an email marketing service or a function at the moment. Maybe doing something on managing for using Calabrio a little bit, but, yeah, that that will be kind of as essential.
Speaker 0: Okay? And can you tell me about your sales process from taking someone from a stranger to a customer?
Speaker 1: Course, ma'am. So, like, We do a lot of outreach on, you know, Instagram and we didn't sales process currently is well, I suppose it it's twofold. Right? Firstly, white label services to two agencies. So a lot of leads would come through there as in going you know, they kind of contract out to me. I work on a new agency. So that's how we get
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: Yep. -- under the transport in terms of sales process, outreach, Instagram, Facebook. Right? We're literally going from, you know, working into a phone or so trying to get them on a call like this, kind of initial discovery call. You know, understanding their needs, understanding their their requirements, delivering and, you know, as well as some KPIs, kinda showcasing what we can do, how we can increase the revenue from that ten to thirty four percent on an initial basis. And then it's probably, like, you're probably looking at maybe, like, you know, highly dependent, but probably four to six week process if I used to kind of be give a good estimate on it. Maybe a little bit more, but I literally just don't have to tell you, man, like, I'm fully managing fully managing this team of three or four people. You know what I mean? August top of these twenty two clinics. Fairly fucking hectic. So Outreach has definitely taken a back seat as a layaway where you are coming in to the fold.
Speaker 0: Do you know your sales closing percentage by any chance?
Speaker 1: No, man. No, I have no clue.
Speaker 0: That's okay. So currently, besides Instagram outreach and LinkedIn outreach, how else are you getting customers?
Speaker 1: Order first, really, my order first. So, like, obviously, we're we're currently with two agencies. Across the UK and Ireland. Mhmm. One's very much focused on the fitness niche. One is kind of generic general e com. Servicing clients all over. So a lot comes from referrals from from those days. This is essentially how we kind of get business outside of that.
Speaker 0: Cool. So besides the referrals, are you doing all the outreach yourself?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Correct.
Speaker 0: Twenty two clients. He must be a busy guy.
Speaker 1: Crazy busy man. Yeah. Crazy busy. What look? We're trying to we're trying to kind of transition out some of those lower paying clients. You know, and and get I suppose, I wanna consolidate. I'd love to have, let's say, like, if we're twenty two at a moment, we kind of bones between maybe twenty two and twenty seven. Or you're dependent out there on Black Friday, and you kinda have more, excuse me, to comment on board, etcetera, etcetera for q four. So, like, ideally, I'd love to drop it down to, like, maybe, you know, consolidate around fifteen to sell seventeen clients that are, you know, kind of fucking high ticket, man, that can actually pay prices and all of fucking give a vote.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So just so I can understand the situation fully, do you have a system at all to get customers at all? No. Okay. So now I just wanna ask you some more specific questions just so I can understand exactly where you are and where you wanna be in terms of metrics. So how much money are you currently making per month for this business?
Speaker 1: We are doing between fuck, man. It depends what we're doing between about eleven fifteen k a month. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: And in twelve months time, months ago?
Speaker 1: Twelve months time, we really wanna be at about fifty k. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: It's a good goal. What's your motivation for getting to fifty?
Speaker 1: Bigger team and legacy. Legacy. Yeah, man. So, like, if we can build out a bigger team, if we can get more money in, if we can provide a higher service, if we can get better paying clients, It means that we can equally grow the business higher, I suppose, better people, better designers, better email marketing consultants, better experts. And then you know, obviously, kinda silo each plane so you could have fucking, you know, one team of, let's say, four people to design or whatever else. Copywriter, etcetera. They're managing ten clients themselves, replicate that team. You know, have another team. They're managing another ten clients. Not a fucking you know, ten clients. So, like, what the finance does, the reason it's fifty k is number one. Obviously, we're operating in a very good profit margin. But number two, like, it frees you up to actually put that additional expenditure back into the business for scalability. That's the kind of goal, way fifty k, and then I wanna branch out to actually acquire in brands. So the acquisition of brands as well. So that that, like, that fifty k will be a good metric to kind of free free up a little bit more time to do an acumen and hire the appropriate people and grow the business.
Speaker 0: Okay. And how would get into fifty k have an impact on other areas of the life?
Speaker 1: Fucking Rolex. Right? I don't know. How will it I suppose getting to that fifty k mark. It just means the proof of concept is fully there. You know what I mean? Business approval model. We have scalability. If you're looking for something like outside investment, it can be, you know, saved money, it can be, I suppose, fucking grabbed from there. If you have the, I suppose, the financial backing, as I said, the proof of concept, the finances to show it, it just opens up a complete different world in terms of actually growing that business to, you know, a million quite a year or a million quite a month. Is ideally where we kinda wanna get to, you know.
Speaker 0: Cool. So, Josh, you're currently at eleven to fifteen k a month. You're going back to fifty k. What do you think is stopping you from getting down your home?
Speaker 1: It's definitely the client acquisition process. The timing and the structure, I think, is key here. You know what I mean? Really building out those processes, but having something that's automated because if I suppose the biggest hindrance at the moment is, like, if if we're looking at, like, white labeling your services to agencies. Right? There's only so much an agency is kind of willing pay, and there's only so much in the agency can put on top of their already existing, let's say, marketing fee that they're charging. So you have to operate at a a slight reduced rate when you're going in under another agency. Whereas if you go direct to clients or, like, direct to consumer, you can charge that, you know, fucking fifteen hundred if you're getting a thirty k and want to just solely come off human marketing. So that's probably the biggest issue. The biggest priority I see at the moment is being too heavy focused on white labeling.
Speaker 0: So am I right in saying that if you get clients directly from the market, not from referrals, you keep the or more of the retainer value? Exactly. Correct. Okay. Perfect. So out of curiosity, you're making eleven to fifteen, you're doing pretty well. Why not say we were?
Speaker 1: Good to fuck one cigarette. Right? Standing still, you're standing there. You know what I mean? I suppose, like, you you have a decent quality of life at that, you know, ten to fifteen kmart or eleven to fifteen kmart. It's brand new product. Fucking what's that? Like, you know what I mean?
Speaker 0: You know,
Speaker 1: just get a corporate job and fucking get a hundred and fifty grand a year. Like,
Speaker 0: No. I agree one hundred percent.
Speaker 1: Oh, we didn't get into this. It's just the fucking hour and ten AM on it. Like, you know, it's actually to build something that you're truly, truly proud of it and stands, I suppose, what stands the the test of time. It's a genuine compliment in twenty years. You know, or ten years or whatever else, you could look back and just be, like, four k. I actually fully built that. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: But that legacy.
Speaker 1: Okay. She might have ties back into election, right, or hundred percent.
Speaker 0: Perfect. So last question. When are you looking to solve this problem?
Speaker 1: Timeline wise, I suppose kind of as soon as possible, you just need to lock down some processes. You know, make sure the team is is in a position where we can actually start taking on those clients. We're most definitely in that capacity. No. Like, definitely get the team to work a little bit harder, you know, but I don't really have a timeline. It's all dependent on a couple of outliers. Number one, fees, cost, and return. You know, I've dealt with a couple of this was kinda closing agencies previously, and it's it's very much paper lead basis. And then they're fucking giving you a lead for a company that has already has an human marketing service. You're jumping on, you're doing consultancy call. There's no intent to bike. And also, it's very dependent on the quality of leads, you know, with is it within our niche to cost our lead and what actually the return is gonna be? I'm quite skeptical, man, to be honest, I used to be in business development there before I got into this for, like, for over six years. So I'm pretty skeptical over the whole sales process.
Speaker 0: Well, based on your answers, based on what you told me, I am very confident that we can help you with this. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what we do?
Speaker 1: Let's do it, man. One percent.
Speaker 0: Sure. So As you might know, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get a lot more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. The ideal agency for us to work with is typically making between eight and twenty k per month with the goal of getting to around thirty to seventy per month. Now these agencies these agency owners specifically, they're doing everything in their business. They are doing outreach, sales, service delivery, etcetera. So we help them to automate their client acquisition, which allows them to stop working in the business, but start working on the business and take more of an ownership role. Our real goal is to build a fully automated client acquisition system that allows you to get consistent meetings with qualified meeting with qualified prospects on demand. Yep.
Speaker 1: Sounds good.
Speaker 0: So I can go into a bit more detail if you like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Let's do it, man. One more sec. So here
Speaker 0: I'm logged. To explain our service briefly. The goal, the sole goal, was to get you more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings of prospects in huge need of services. So we'll start by creating a new offer and design a unique messaging that will stand out and attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll use we'll utilize this messaging in highly personalized outreach campaigns. We will target and book meetings with the most qualified prospects for you, this is at least twenty k revenue per month, actually above fifty k at least, like you said. Plus it's completely organic, meaning you don't have to risk any money on ad spend. In addition to this, the entire process from start to finish is one hundred percent done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up the calls with qualified prospects and sell them services that they already want. It's quite simple. And I assume this will help you free up a lot of time for you. So the entire service in conclusion was designed by an agency owner, four agency owners. Looking to break through and systemize the outreach to get to around forty to seventy k per month. Okay.
Speaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about the business. Are you fully are you an age like, are you the the agency owner? Do you work for for another agency. What's the kind of background?
Speaker 0: My background is that I used to run my own agency, an advertising agency, offering Facebook and Google advertising. This was a few years back and I transitioned into helping agency on this.
Speaker 1: Okay. And how many is on the teams you choose yourself?
Speaker 0: No. It's myself in about forty members, but it fluctuates. Because I'm mainly hire contractors and we scale as we take on more clients.
Speaker 1: Yeah. And what's the Outreach process into your messaging LinkedIn messaging. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Combination of cold email and LinkedIn outreach. Okay.
Speaker 1: Sweet man. Can you send me over a more documentation?
Speaker 0: Sure can. What do you need?
Speaker 1: I did a full proposal. Please, if you don't mind. I'm probably not gonna be, like, any other person who worked with. As I said, like, I'm a hundred percent open and willing to to to do whatever it takes to get this done. I just need I suppose a little bit more I know you're probably looking for the clothes on the call, but I'm looking for more concrete I suppose. What I want is case studies if you have them? Mhmm. What for proposal? I wanna put a background to you and the team if possible. As well. So just any sales collateral that you have that you can send over. And I know you're probably shooting for the the the clothes on the call for you know, I'd I'd need a little bit more a little bit more sales collateral to lead. This the the process seans exactly what I'm looking for. Ethan to be perfectly honest. It sounds, you know, exactly what we need in terms of this outreach and having that fully automated. I'm just literally showing up to call and it's jumping on. Onto prospects, you know, issues and then just going from there, either closing or not. So within that, let's segue into your pricing. I presume you do you work off a closed commission basis or as a per lead basis? Or how how would you work your commission?
Speaker 0: So our fee for managing and holding the system starts with a one time setup fee of three thousand dollars. And from there, it's one hundred dollars per appointment. But after doing this for a long time, we found that people who make decisions quickly always turn out to be the best clients and we get them the best results. So for those reasons, we have something called incentive based pricing where I know you don't like this, but if you make the decision with me today -- Mhmm. -- I've got the setup fee in half, and then it's just a one time setup fee of one thousand five hundred dollars. And one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.
Speaker 1: So your real price is fifteen hundred because you just knocked to play fifty percent.
Speaker 0: Did I say that?
Speaker 1: Well, it was three thousand dollars. I know it's fifteen hundred dollars.
Speaker 0: Three thousand dollars if you don't make the decision today.
Speaker 1: That's alright, man. Yep. Hundred percent. So that makes sense. Yeah. I was kind of expecting in a roundabout ballpark. Because that's kind of why it's supposed usually where it is roughly for kind of lead generation side of things. What what I will do, Ethan, if you will you please, Semiana Claro? Like, if we have to pay the three k? I have to pray that we get not to push just as long as I suppose we have that trust and, you know, I have a full understanding of what's actually happening at each stage. It will be ideal for me.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. Absolutely. And broke with regards to what you were saying about the one call close. That's not really my intention. Yeah. As I'm sure everyone will say. Bye. I don't really care. Obviously, I care, but I don't care if we close. It's -- Yeah.
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: -- more about actually being able to help.
Speaker 1: Yeah. As
Speaker 0: you see, my entire business model is based around performance. After the setup fees, we don't get you phenomenal results, we don't get anything. So I'm not like you or yourself. You don't wanna work with people for a month and then just flip them. So, yeah, sixty
Speaker 1: Hundred percent. Long term growth, man.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So this isn't some objection handling technique. But since we are in the call, can I answer any questions? Can I give you a better understanding and remove any doubt that you might
Speaker 1: have? That's alright. I'll go, man. I I do really appreciate the time. I think you've taught me through, everybody. Definitely like to see a couple of case stories if possible later. You know, maybe anybody that you worked with within the space. Is email marketing something that you kinda specialize in? Or is it you just looking at anybody who's kinda doing, you know, as well as add agencies, etcetera?
Speaker 0: We work with all agencies, but email marketing is probably one of my preferred just because the the offer is so much better.
Speaker 1: Right, man. It's like no fucking ad spend. Yes. So your monthly and then your whatever your your email -- Yeah. -- monthly.
Speaker 0: It's very appealing.
Speaker 1: Okay. Well, yeah. That sounds brilliant, man. Mhmm. We should say, you know, give me a good insight. You have my email if you wanna send me over that, and then maybe we can schedule a call once I kinda have a review. If I have any questions in the meantime, I'll just drop you a message on LinkedIn, or I will drop you a email that might have some bits and pieces that'll come back to today, later on today.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. There's something I wanna mention on the case side though. Yeah. Because of the cumulative nature of the digital marketing space, of course, we actually can't give out our client's names. Yeah. That's right. This is because if I compared this new way to look, they could just, you know, do the exact thing we're doing. Really? What's saying this? I still really want you to share the confidence that I have in this service. Yeah. And I hope the business model can also speak for itself the fact that we have to get you results. We have no choice but to get you results. And our incentives are completely aligned. So which is why I wanted to mention this about the case studies.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. No. It makes perfect sense. Well, you just expect it as much to be honest in terms of, like, actually not giving away client's names. Mhmm. Probably privileged information. What kind of anything that you can consent collateralized status collateralized, please just send it out to me so kind of a quick review.
Speaker 0: Absolutely. It's great meeting it too.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Your agenda. I really appreciate the time on.
Speaker 0: You know what? I will contact you straight away on LinkedIn, and I will email you some more information.
Speaker 1: Your gents. I really appreciate it. I'll be back to you later on today. Thanks, Ethan.
