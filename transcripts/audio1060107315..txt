Speaker 0:  Legends. Are you doing brother?
Speaker 1: Hello, Ethan.
Speaker 0: Good to see you guys. Good to see you guys. How are you? Oh, can you guys hear me? I can hear you. Can you hear me?
Speaker 1: Yes. Yes. I can hear you. Good.
Speaker 0: Alright. Fantastic. Cool, man. Sorry. You guys been good? Had a good weekend?
Speaker 1: Doing good. Yeah. Yeah. Getting started with It's another week.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Alright. Cool. Is Mat√≠as the correct pronunciation? Just the lima?
Speaker 1: That's right. Yep. That's it.
Speaker 0: Yes. And Rodrigo. Prodigal. Yes. Prodigal. That's fine. Alright. Cool. Yeah. Last thing I wanna do is mess up the names right at the beginning. But yeah.
Speaker 1: Oh, no worries. No worries about that.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. So I was looking forward to the call. I really wanted to see how we could potentially help you guys out. If you open to it, I can get us started with this entire process if you'd like.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Let let's do it. We are also, you know, intrigue on on where your services are, what is exactly that you do. So go ahead. We we'd love to to hear it.
Speaker 0: Amazing. So how the calls usually go with very simple. I just want to start off by asking some quick questions, help me understand where you guys are at, where you want to be, and if we could potentially help you get there, And then, obviously, if you seem like a good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer in a ton of detail and then, you know, answer any questions that you might have, then we can go from there. Is that okay with you guys?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Sounds good. Yep.
Speaker 0: Amazing. So best place to start. What made you wanna schedule the call in the first place?
Speaker 1: Right. So, I guess, as usual or as most of your clients, we wanna grow our our, let's say, our sales necessarily the amount of clients. We actually wanna, you know, grow our our average ticket to us to call it, let's say. We wanna start basically charging more for our services because we know, like, we can do that, especially if we get more clients from the US or Europe. As you know, we are based in Argentina and Well, you know, clients local clients at least don't usually have enough money to cover, you know, international fees. So The idea is to to try and grow a little more outside the country. And that way, we can get, you know, better and higher fees, basically.
Speaker 0: Hundred percent That's amazing. So increasing your pricing, increasing your ticket size by going after international brands as opposed to just staying in Argentina, so going after US, Europe.
Speaker 1: That's right.
Speaker 0: That ones like those.
Speaker 1: That's right. We currently are working with a couple brands in in Spain, specifically, and the US. But yeah, it's not yet significant in our, you know, monthly ticket, let's say, or yearly ticket. So that that's why we we wanna grow it.
Speaker 0: That's perfect. And we've had a ton of clients who come on in the exact same situation. So let's actually get a number on it. Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna grow too?
Speaker 1: Right. So, basically, at least in my case, I I I don't like to to set, you know, goals in in such a specific way. Basically, what I wanna get to is I wanna try and see, you know, as a first step because this is this would be a and absolute first step for us. I wanna try and see if we can get at least one client to change in the short term in the next month. With a set pricing we've defined, which is eighteen hundred dollars a month for social media and Google Ads. And then we'll go from there. Of course, that, you know, the sky is the limit as as much as we can. And it would be the the better and and, you know, that's what we we're aiming to. But I just wanna start with one just to, you know, make sure that that the model works and that they actually are people out there are willing to pay for that. Yeah. So yeah. But that's that's basically I I like to focus on the the immediate short term instead of, you know, planning so long ahead.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Hundred percent. Just get the first wins and then talk about the major goals after that?
Speaker 1: That's right. Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 0: So just just so I know on the same page, you said one client signed in the next month at one thousand eight hundred per month?
Speaker 1: At least. Yeah. Yeah. Because that'll be ideal.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That should be very, very doable. How much are you charging right now?
Speaker 1: So right now, just so you get an idea, you know, we started about three years ago. And we've had, you know, all kinds of clients, you know, we have some clients we we actually started with at the very beginning. You know, others have come and gone throughout the way. And our structure right now, basically, we have eight fixed monthly clients and then a couple that just come and go with, you know, one time things like websites or whatever. And we're bringing in about fifty five hundred dollars a month with those paid clients. So, basically, like, in an ideal world, if we could swap those eight clients for this eighteen hundred a month -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: we would go considerably up. Say, yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I think we we all know that it's definitely possible to be charging a higher, you know, for our clients to work with now, we don't recommend charging under three thousand at least. So okay. I mean, one thousand eight hundred, that's very, very doable. Out of curiosity, like, what's stopping you from just charging more right now from just raising your prices?
Speaker 1: Right. So to be honest, basically, we have not yet started, you know, you know, doing any kind of ads or or any kind of outreach strategy. We're we're kind of just waiting to see how to to move forward, basically. We are about to launch a new landing page on our website specifically, you know, directed to this kind of public or client type. But we don't know where to start it. If it is through our own ads, you know, become our own clients, sort of speak, or to just work with somebody else and partner up and try and find, you know, different ways to to get to clients, basically, and then convert leads So so that that's where we're standing, basically. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Cool. So you're not too sure whether you should do your own ads, get someone else to do it. And then -- Yeah. -- you go after the international clients, that's an important thing because locally, they might not be able to pay that much. But if you go after US, UK, Canada, paying three k, five k a month is pretty normal, honestly. Yeah. The same service as I do. Okay. Cool.
Speaker 1: That's good.
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I don't have eight clients now in total. Let's bring you in around five thousand five hundred per month.
Speaker 1: That's right. Yes.
Speaker 0: Perfect. And let's say, I know you don't wanna put the exact number on it. But in the ideal world, you're able to be signing clients predictably, internationally. Do you have any sort of monthly figure that you'd like to hit?
Speaker 1: So honestly, as I said before, I I don't like to to said, you know, specific goals in the long term. The the one thing I'm, you know, most, let's say, quote unquote, worried about is how many clients we can actually work with at at the size team we are right now. I know we can, you know, we could easily double insights right now. You know, we can go to to ten clients or to sixteen clients. No worries. But then it depends a lot on the on the type of clients and on the needs they have, you know, at the same let's say, kinds of services. There's different levels of of demand the client might have. So, again, it's not it's not necessarily easy for us to to calculate it in in number of clients or or in an exact amount per month. You know, it depends on what comes about, I guess. But, you know, I'm I'm with the people we have right now, there's eight of us in total. I'm sure we can work with at least twenty clients for sure. And then, of course, we we would add that to whatever comes our way.
Speaker 0: Yeah. No. That's what so you have eighteen members. So you definitely have capacity to take on a lot more clients, like you said, around two areas. And we charge at least two thousand for an extra twelve clients that's, like, an extra twenty four thousand per month at your current capacity. Which is great. Okay. Cool. So we know that, you know, you add around five thousand five hundred now. The goal is to sign more clients because you already have the capacity. Right? So it's the capacity already there. That's not a problem. We just need more people. We used to be speaking of people. So who actually is your ideal client?
Speaker 1: Right. So, basically, we work on on three different stages of brands, let's say, starting with, you know, people that just don't have anything set up yet, not even a brand name or logo or or any kind of, let's say, visual concept for their company. So they need everything from us. We'll start there and then we move on to website developments and as we call it digital assets. So all, you know, social media accounts and websites landing pages, you know, conversion funnels, everything. And then the final leg of the service would be, you know, marketing campaigns and automations and email marketing or kinds of communication efforts, let's say. And I would say, you know, the perfect line would be the one that covers all three stages, but we don't like to limit, you know, our services to them. You know, if somebody we've had a couple examples of people that come with really good branding, you know, material and they just need a website or sometimes they even come with a website that doesn't really perform that well, and then we'd help them you know, make it better or just add, you know, landing pages to it. So yeah. That's basically all of we can cover, but, you know, any kind of line within those areas would be fine.
Speaker 0: That makes a lot of sense. So you're able to do a lot of things So, like, the landing pages, the funnels, marketing campaigns. But for some clients only need a specific part of it. So you'll just offer that to them. But the ideal client would actually cover all three of the bases of your service because you can pro provide a lot more value. Chargeable?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Basically basically, that that's that's it. We we would provide a lot more value. We get to know the client better. They get to trust us more. To we would, of course, get higher fees with them because we'd be we'd be covering more. And in those specific cases, we we actually, you know, kind of become, like, an alternative to an an in house team.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.
Speaker 1: As that kind of, you know, makes at least in in my view, it's what makes more sense, let's say, or what what kind of gives us an idea or or kind of Azure says that that client is gonna stay with us for at least, you know, six months or a year.
Speaker 0: Yeah. You made such a good point there because the more integrated you are into the actual client, the more you're doing for them -- Yeah. -- or it's Like, it's a sticky partnership because you're not just, like, agency that just did, like, a landing page. You're actually, like, fully integrated into their business. Which is ideal based on for much longer period of time. That's great. Mhmm. Okay. Cool. So To summarize that, I think we can determine that your ideal client wouldn't necessarily be the guy, you know, just starting out that just needs a website like desperately It's more so someone that has the budget, is already established, but can still benefit from all three components of your service. Because if you can do that, they'll stay for longer, you can provide more value, and you can charge a lot more. While not having to allocate resources towards, you know, the beginnings. Does that make sense?
Speaker 1: Yeah. It does. It does.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. Then I think that would be the ideal strategy. And then for sales, let's say we were to be able to, you know, generate a ton of leads who would actually be taking these calls.
Speaker 1: So in that case, it would be me at the beginning. And, yeah, if it's well, again, I I don't know, you know, what you're used to to generating monthly, but I guess I could easily get those calls. And then if I ever need some help, I can't get help. So it's not a problem. Yeah.
Speaker 0: That's perfect. Okay. Cool. So just to recap everything, the goal is to go from, you know, fifty five hundred way or right now to I guess, hitting your capacity first. And I think that would be around an extra twenty, thirty thousand per month. Obviously, I can vary depending on the client size, but it'll be around that much. So adding an extra twenty, thirty k per month. And in order to do that, we're just gonna get you speaking to a lot more qualified prospects on a daily basis. Right? You have the foundations you have, the team, you have case studies you have results. All of that's already taken care of. You just need to be speaking to more of these people every single day. And if we can solve that one problem, then, I mean, scale will be pretty much straightforward. Is anything I missed there?
Speaker 1: Good. No. So, basically, again, just to be completely honest, The one thing we are not that, you know, strong one at least for now is we we don't have really solid case studies that say to to basically sell to a bigger or medium sized company based in the US. You know? They I know they expect,
Speaker 0: you know,
Speaker 1: you know, people like us to show, like, really good results and and and, you know, to prove how much value we add. And, basically, we do have a couple success stories, but nothing that really amounts to,
Speaker 0: you
Speaker 1: know, touching three thousand or eighteen hundred even a month. Mhmm. So that's got a difficult thing for us to to work through at least now, but I'm sure we can. I mean, again, it depends a little on on who's on the other side if it's So that's why, you know, I said before we were we might be inclined to work with smaller companies or upcoming companies more than, you know, big players. But then again, it depends a lot on, as I said, who's on the other side and how much they want us to prove. Basically, our our strongest site right now is website design, basically, and functionality and automations and integrations with different tools.
Speaker 0: Yeah.
Speaker 1: So, basically, that that's what all the best thing we have to show at least right now.
Speaker 0: Got it. And it's a very, I wanna say, self aware thing to say because it is true that these companies do expect a lot in terms of having past results. So -- Yep. -- we've had clients in the past who came on with minimal case studies. And I can share how we'd recommend moving forward because, like, in the situation. But just so that I can get an idea of it and provide the best feedback, the outcomes of your case studies right now, are there any sort of tangible outcomes like increase in speed, increase in sales, increase in conversions, anything to this degree that you can actually measure?
Speaker 1: Or yes? Yes. All of them, you know, show, you know, growth or success at least on on the first objectives that were, you know, defined with the client. But the thing is they Like, most of them don't really amount to that much money at least, you know, have it work with people in in Argentina. If you, you know, bring that to to a US or Canada scale or, you know, something Europeans might be used to, it looks like it's just ten cents a dollar, you know.
Speaker 0: So the only case of study we have is Skype for Moli.
Speaker 1: But Yeah. So that's right. What what are the best so that that's a great example. One of the best case studies we have or success stories is a a German, Argentinian company that provides services for farmers. Front land, let's say, basically, what what what they've developed is a an app that works with satellites and, you know, blueprints from farmers that lets them know, you know, when to let's say, what what's the name of this? When the plant sees how much product to use or whatever, some some things like that. Basically, what we achieved is an an extra amount of monthly downloads of that app through iOS. But then that, you know, that doesn't really does didn't really bring in a direct. Yeah. Commercial, let's say, result to the company. For now, it's just downloads. It doesn't really we kinda really measure it in in money, but, you know, it's something pretty interesting mainly because they were working with a a another sizing company facing Germany before when they were, you know, investing almost ten times what we were investing. And we are investing now, let's say, and and we're getting, you know, twice as many leads and twice as many downloads a month. So that's something interesting to to show.
Speaker 0: That's great. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I appreciate you sharing that. And based on that and the current size of the business, I don't think we'd be able to help you directly in terms of what we do in terms of the done for you growth partnership. And I'll share why, and then I'll share what I'd recommend moving forward, and I can answer any questions that you might have. But the reason why initially, at least at this point. It's just because of the size of the company in terms of, you know, revenue amount and then the case studies as well. So the main one is or the first one is the revenue. For example, our fees are probably around five thousand nine hundred per month. So it drastically eaten into the actual revenue. And it's not the best state to be in, you know, us taking, like, all the new, it's messes with you in terms of thinking, and then the case studies as well. So what we look for always is very tangible, very outcome based, revenue based case studies that we can leverage in the actual marketing to book these calls. So Based on what you told me though, what I'd recommend is I definitely think you have the capabilities of charging a lot more now. I don't think you need to wait to be able to increase your prices. I think and this is from speaking to Asian sellers every single day. What we realize is it's less important what you do, but it's more important who you do it for. Right? So you can decide to work with the beginners, the people just starting out, they just need a website, they've never done business before, and they're figuring everything else out and they have no money. And you can charge a thousand dollars. Or you could work with a massive company, Fortune five hundred company, do the exact same thing. But charge a hundred times more. Yes. I think the first thing that you could do to grasically increase things is change who you're talking. And, you know, based on your past case, let us figure out who had the most money and you enjoyed working with. And then go after them specifically. Because it will just give you a much better experience moving forward. Good.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's right.
Speaker 0: And I'm I'm sorry that we can't help you out on this. But do you have any questions personally?
Speaker 1: Oh, no worries. Yeah. It's very clear. We we've actually, you know, talked with a couple, you know, competitors of yours and say, and they all come down to the same conclusion. So it makes sense, you know, of course, if it makes sense. But it's nice to, you know, I guess, to hear it again and, you know, to understand where we're at and to make sure that we can move forward on on the right path, basically. So so thank you thank you a lot. Thanks a lot for your time.
Speaker 0: Look, I appreciate it very much. It was great speaking to both of you. And if you have any questions after this call, please follow me so you can message me. I'm happy to answer it. We'd love to see you guys do well, and we can potentially work via this picture. You. Just at this time, we wouldn't be able to do it. But other than that, thank you very much for coming on the call.
Speaker 1: Sounds sounds good. Thank you so much, Ethan.
Speaker 0: Cool. Have a great day, guys. Yep.
Speaker 1: Yep. Bye bye.
