Speaker 0:  And it sounds how it works. Julian.
Speaker 1: Hi.
Speaker 0: How are you?
Speaker 1: Hi. I'm good. Can you?
Speaker 0: Excellent. How's your week been so far?
Speaker 1: It's been okay. Yesterday, I've been pretty pretty tired and sick because I just did my third vaccine dose, but now I'm good.
Speaker 0: Third one. Same. Could you reschedule the call if you're if you're feeling sick?
Speaker 1: No. I'm good enough. Oh, good.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. Oh, with the with the whole video and why I do these things audio only, by all means, you can keep your video on.
Speaker 1: I don't mind.
Speaker 0: The reason I do it is it just allows us to focus more on what's being said then. Some people, like, worrying about the hair and things like that.
Speaker 1: Okay. I don't mind.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. So if you're ready to get started, we can go ahead.
Speaker 1: Yeah. Sure.
Speaker 0: Cool. So how these calls usually go is I just wanna stop by asking some questions just to understand your business where you are and where you wanna be. Then if it sounds like you'll be a good fit, I'll explain our service, how it works, and everything else, then at the end, you can decide if you wanna be a part of it or not. Is that okay with
Speaker 1: you? Okay. Yep. Perfect.
Speaker 0: Cool. So tell me what motivated you to schedule this call today?
Speaker 1: Well, just to yeah. I started, like, my my agency three months ago.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: So it's pretty new. We got a client now and a few possible clients in the upcoming weeks.
Speaker 0: Congratulations. And
Speaker 1: Thank you. And, yeah, we we just we just want to to get clients and and train with the calls and everything. So we can we can scale our business and start to automate everything and and just, yeah, get new clients.
Speaker 0: So how do you currently go about getting clients?
Speaker 1: Right now, I'm doing cold email outreach. I'm also doing some Like, I'm conducting prospects through email, through Instagram, through LinkedIn, and a bunch of cold calling too, but it didn't go that well. So I stopped for a while. And, yep, that's pretty much it. Right now, I'm doing a manual outreach, so I'm sending everything myself because I like to personalize everything for for the clients. But in the future, we'll surely automate everything and focus on on the the calls.
Speaker 0: So would it be fair to say that right now in your business, getting clients, getting meetings is the biggest bottleneck right now?
Speaker 1: Yep. Yeah.
Speaker 0: Cool. Correct. So correct me if I'm wrong, but you saw paid advertisement. Right? Mhmm. And how much do you charge for that?
Speaker 1: It depends on how much on the ad ad's been budget of the of the client. Basically, what we did was we have, like, three pricing methods. One for like, one if the clients want to spend between one k and six k per month, which charge them five sixty nine dollars and fifteen percent performance fee. Then if they want to up their Hudson budget between six k and twenty k. It's nineteen hundred dollars plus ten percent performance fee. And if they want to spend more than twenty k, it's four thousand dollars plus five percent performance fee. Because at that point, will take more from the performance even from the base fee.
Speaker 0: Cool. So the clients you look for are ones with higher budgets.
Speaker 1: Yeah. It it's possible. Yeah.
Speaker 0: So We're gonna take a Yeah. We're gonna take
Speaker 1: a all all kind of price, like, small medium and big. Right now, we have just a small client, but we we surely want to we're contacting, like, more whale clients. So -- Yeah.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: we can we can upgrade our our our revenue.
Speaker 0: So do you have a ideal client or ideal prospect in mind?
Speaker 1: Yes. Sure. Let me think about this. Are you a client? Would be already established brand that already ran at, if possible. But want to focus on something else, so they just want to delegate the whole paid traffic service. So yeah. So times that span at least seven eight k a month and that's been something like this. Mhmm. And and, yeah, just online stores, e commerce stores, and info product businesses.
Speaker 0: Cool. And can you walk me through your sales process?
Speaker 1: Like, the calls with with the client.
Speaker 0: Yeah. The process from taking someone from a complete stranger to a bank client today.
Speaker 1: Okay. So first of all, we send them a an email or d we could take them, like, from LinkedIn, something like this. And we tried to to sell the meeting, so they can agree to go on a first call with us. If they agree, we cannot do, like, the same here just like, a first date call, see if it'd be a good feed, ask some questions and everything. And if we'll be a good fit, we just schedule a second call with the the CMO also, and we just go through through the numbers, the pricing, what we can really do and etcetera. And if they agree after that, just they they just go through the onboarding process. And and that's it.
Speaker 0: Cool. So now we just wanna know your process for doing outreach and forgetting clients in the past. You said a lot of cold messaging, didn't really like the cold calling. What else have you
Speaker 1: done now? We tried okay. We tried five things five different things. A lot of email outreach that we're still doing, a lot of Instagram DMs, a lot of LinkedIn connections, So, yeah, the cold calling that we stopped, like, two weeks ago, but we might we might go on again and a bit of of of work outreach. Oh, yeah.
Speaker 0: So do you have a process in place to get customers? Or system like this.
Speaker 1: What what do you mean?
Speaker 0: You just have a how can I say a predictable process for getting meetings?
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Okay. Like, if I send that that much email, that the percentage of meetings I can book for meetings?
Speaker 0: Exactly that. Yeah.
Speaker 1: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Basically, we we have, like, this email tracker for the open reply and meetings book rates. We saw call that for about a a hundred and fifty emails that we send. We booked around yeah, not that much, like, one or two meetings. Yeah. So we have to to improve on that.
Speaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So you're gonna improve. You're gonna get that numbers. Right?
Speaker 1: Yeah. We we have a a good open rate, like, something sixty five, thirty percent. We have pretty decent reply rates. That is let me see. Yeah. That is okay. Like, seventeen percent. And from the people replying, we got, like, two percent or, like yeah. Two percent of people actually be booking a meeting. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: Okay. And thanks for telling me the info. So now I just wanna figure out exactly where you are with a metric and where you wanna be in the future. So how much money are you currently making per month for this business?
Speaker 1: Right now, just with the one client, we're making around fifteen fifteen hundred dollars a month. And yeah. So I've got a whole business road map right here. You want to get at least, like, four or five clients for the end of April, and we're aiming for ten clients for December. That's what we are aiming for.
Speaker 0: That's cool. So in twelve months' time, what do you think the revenue per month goal would be?
Speaker 1: So in March twenty twenty three, something realistic. If possible, like, twenty five k a month revenue would be would be really awesome.
Speaker 0: Definitely think as possible. What's your motivation for getting to twenty five k?
Speaker 1: I have working. Twenty four seven and just out bridge all the time to get clients and train for calls.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: And then hire more people.
Speaker 0: So you wanna automate some of this stuff?
Speaker 1: Yeah. For sure. Mhmm.
Speaker 0: So how would the business actually change if you got the twenty five k a month?
Speaker 1: Oh, well, firstly, right now, we're, like, four in the in the agency for myself. Facebook and Google Ads Manager, creative and video designer for the ads, and lead generation that brings me lead every week. And, yeah, twelve months, what would change would be great to have, like, company of maybe eight, nine people so we can handle all the clients focused on the customer care and automate everything and just scale and choose our own clients if possible.
Speaker 0: Mhmm.
Speaker 1: That would that would be great. Yep.
Speaker 0: Yeah. So you work with, like, in most qualified prospects, not just anyone.
Speaker 1: Exactly. Yeah. Right now, we're we're not taking anyone, but we're not really ending on the quality of the prospects. There there have to be, like, they have to to spend at least, like, two, three k a month on on ad spend and just be a non night store, and and that's it. But in the future, if we can choose, like, where clients and everything, if we would be would be awesome.
Speaker 0: Cool. And what type of Is there any specific niche that you want in the future?
Speaker 1: Well, right now, we're doing all kinds of we're doing like fashion brands. We're doing cosmetic brands, jewelry brands. And I think that's it. But maybe in the future, we'll we'll just focus on one niche that might probably be, I don't know, between fashion and cosmetics. I I don't know.
Speaker 0: Yeah. In the future, you'll have the choice So last last one, how would twenty five k, you know, have an impact on you specifically?
Speaker 1: Like, on my on my cell phone on personal basis?
Speaker 0: Yeah. Personal.
Speaker 1: Well, it's a huge impact because right now, I'm I'm living in in this small small apartments in Spain. And I just want to to like, travel the world. That's the only thing I wanna do. Go to to Australia. And yeah. I just need the need the money to do that. And then set up for a bigger bigger house, bigger apartments and -- Mhmm.
Speaker 0: --
Speaker 1: and start things from there.
Speaker 0: Have a Australia readiness?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Just
Speaker 0: keep that in mind.
Speaker 1: Australia is, like, major country to go. That's like that's one of the main reasons I added this business is just to travel.
Speaker 0: Really?
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: That's nice. That's really nice. So you're currently at one five one thousand five hundred dollars per month. You wanna get twenty five k? What do you think stopping you from? Calendar on your own?
Speaker 1: I don't think anything is stopping me right now, but I just have to to keep being consistent and just to try different things with the outreach and maybe in twelve months, I'll get to it. But, yeah, patience and consistency, I think, are, like, the the key points for me getting there. Just something to do to to work every day.
Speaker 0: So you're comfortable with getting that job?
Speaker 1: Well, I like working. But if I can maybe focus focus on something because Outreach is taking me eighty percent of of my day. So if I could focus, like, on more systems or more rebranding on the sales call and everything? Would be a huge relief too. But I I could maybe do it alone. I I don't know.
Speaker 0: Yeah. That makes sense. So you're currently making one thousand five hundred. Why not just continue what you're doing? Stay where you are.
Speaker 1: That's enough. That's just not enough. I'll do to do more and be here.
Speaker 0: Okay. I see. When you're actually looking to, you know, start taking on more clients,
Speaker 1: Sorry?
Speaker 0: When do you actually want to start taking on new clients every more meeting today?
Speaker 1: As as soon as possible. K.
Speaker 0: Based on your answers, based on what you told me, based on where you want to be, I have a lot of confidence that I think I can help you with this. Would you like me to briefly explain what I do, then you can ask any questions that you might know?
Speaker 1: Yeah. For sure.
Speaker 0: Cool. So as you might know, our area of expertise is in helping agency owners to get a lot more clients by filling the calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agents that we work with, they're just starting out usually between zero and eight k per month. With a goal of getting to around twenty to fifty k. Typically, these owners are doing everything in the business themselves, outreach service delivery sales, And their main goal is usually to free up a lot of time and take more of an ownership role to stop working in the business but to work on the business. They usually look into a high ticket. Typically, e commerce clients, the ones with high budgets that can spend a lot. That's what they're looking for. And, yeah, based on what you told me, it seems like it'd be a great foot for what we do. Love to hear what you think.
Speaker 1: Well, it could be really great. But it all it depends on on the budget, of course. Because I'm I'm having, like, fifteen hundred dollars a month, but a lot of that I'm just reinvesting and putting in in my team and on the on the outreach and keeping a little bit. So depends on budget.
Speaker 0: So you'd like to know the pricing?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Let me take it.
Speaker 0: Sure. So Our fee for building and managing the system is a one time setup fee of fifteen hundred dollars and then from the it's only one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. So one thousand five hundred dollars for for WAN exactly. Like, what do you do with that?
Speaker 0: The setup, please?
Speaker 1: Yeah.
Speaker 0: Sure. So firstly, it goes into all the costs associated with running your account, like the software's the account manager, the niche research, the lead sourcing, etcetera. Yeah. Pretty much just a cost associated with running your account?
Speaker 1: Mhmm. Okay. And then from that, every call that I get it's a hundred dollars.
Speaker 0: Every qualified prospect that shows up. So only prospects that meet your criteria that actually come to the meeting.
Speaker 1: Okay. Interesting. Yeah. This would be doable, I think. I'll just have to to talk a bit with my team, but yeah. Maybe with my team more.
Speaker 0: Sure. Would your CMO be opposed to moving forward?
Speaker 1: No. No. Just to to keep him accountable of of the call and and just to talk about this with him and I'm pretty sure he felt happy. Mhmm. But just to so I I don't do everything long.
Speaker 0: Oh, sure. No. Totally. It makes sense. Just out of curiosity, does he know Sorry. I think I cut out there. Mhmm. What was that saying?
Speaker 1: Like, that's you know?
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Doesn't know you're coming on this call today or that you came on the call today?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We have, like, this channel with every appointment set up, which everybody. So you they know.
Speaker 0: Okay. Cool. Okay. That's perfect. I definitely recommend that you speak to him. I wouldn't would want you to make a decision with our consultant. When would you be able to speak?
Speaker 1: On on Monday? Yeah. Monday would be great.
Speaker 0: Monday? Okay.
Speaker 1: Yep.
Speaker 0: Would you be opposed to scheduling follow-up or we can just confirm everything?
Speaker 1: No. Yeah. Not at all. We can do Monday same time, actually, for sure. Drop with it.
Speaker 0: Yep. Perfect. I'll write that down. Finally, I just wanna make sure everything's clear with me at least. Are you saying that you are on board and ready to move forward and you just need to get a yes from him or are there some doubts elsewhere?
Speaker 1: From my end, it would be, like, there's a of course, there's a couple of doubts because I'm putting, like, my money online. But from my end, I would be willing to risk it. I mean, I'll I'll just speak with the others and and on Monday, I'll I'll tell you if we're good or not. That's it.
Speaker 0: Excellent. Because this is if there's any doubts, you know, we're right we're here with each other right now. I'd be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything for you.
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah. Because, like, fifteen hundred dollars is not that much. But for my starting agency, it's like, So it's like fifty percent of the revenue we have. So that's a bit of money. But if this works, like, how how many how many clients do you can I have no how many quality leads that show to meetings can you provide per month with this?
Speaker 0: Sure. That's a good question. And one that gets asked almost every call, So as you know, everyone's different. I can't guarantee anything, but what I've seen on average is ten to twenty meetings per month. In the first one to two months is a ramp up process. This is just to keep everything all your accounts safe and everything when we do outreach. But on average, when it stabilizes ten to twenty and then that can be scaled up limitlessly.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. And does your price does your price always stay the same or does it scale also with the clients we're having?
Speaker 0: It stays the same at one hundred dollars per appointment.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. That's pretty good. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident we'll be working with you. But, yeah, as I said, I just have to to notify everyone and and I'll speak to you on Monday about it.
Speaker 0: That sounds great. That's great speaking to you. Do you have any further questions? I don't have to answer anything.
Speaker 1: Let me see. I don't think so. Yeah. Like, when do we pay you? Yeah. How many Like, how many days or weeks do I start getting my first calls?
Speaker 0: Good question. So the first week will pretty much be designated to can you are getting onboarded, fast to get understanding of your ideal target, ideal niche, then we'll be sourcing everything. So the first week, that'll be designated to onboarding. And from there, we'll start sending messages. So --
Speaker 1: Okay.
Speaker 0: -- within the first twenty one days, we'll be doing outreach. First fourteen days even.
Speaker 1: Okay. And what kind of I don't know if I you can answer answer this. What what kind of outbridge will you do?
Speaker 0: We use a combination of cold email and LinkedIn.
Speaker 1: Okay. Okay. I clicked in self navigator. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, that I I don't think I have further questions.
Speaker 0: Perfect. So I can schedule the call for Monday, same time?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Sure.
Speaker 0: If you
Speaker 1: can send me the the calendar link, if you want, or we can just say it like this.
Speaker 0: Yeah. I'll send the calendar links straightaway on LinkedIn after the call.
Speaker 1: Okay. Perfect.
Speaker 0: Perfect. Man, it was great meeting you. Great speaking to you.
Speaker 1: Yeah. You too. Yeah. Thank you.
Speaker 0: Thank you for coming on this call today. We'll message you straight afterwards.
