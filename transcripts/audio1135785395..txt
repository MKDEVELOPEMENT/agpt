Speaker 0: Not not exactly.
Speaker 1: Got it. And were you the one that booked it in?
Speaker 0: You know. Yeah. I I I guess so. But do you know what my business is about?
Speaker 2: No. That's the real reason for this call.
Speaker 3: I just make sure we are talking about the correct thing.
Speaker 1: Do you mind giving a quick overview of what you guys do?
Speaker 0: I'm gonna give you two short, and then I'll I'll wait to hear from you. So we're a a wholesale company, business to business. We import the manufacturer optical frame. Mhmm. And we sell to optical shop and eye doctors across the United States. So it's a friend.
Speaker 1: Okay. That's perfect. Okay. In that case, I think there's a potentially a mistake in the actual booking. Essentially on our side. I'm scheduling you in for the call because we we don't help those sorts of businesses. But yeah.
Speaker 0: Okay. Well, this this is
Speaker 4: a little unfortunate because I asked on the email, like, said, did I you do understand that when
Speaker 0: I have this e commerce business -- Yeah. -- like, yeah. Yeah. Sure. That's fine. So, you know, just to get another meeting, another I mean, Yeah. That could wait for that one to five.
Speaker 1: Yeah. I'm I'm really sorry about that. I'll check.
Speaker 0: Alright.
Speaker 1: That's where the issue came from. But again, sorry Yeah.
Speaker 0: I know. So I got it. A ton of emails. So I mean, especially after hearing this, it's very frustrating. So please, you know, I unsubscribed please take me off the list. I don't wanna get email or anything like that. Okay?
Speaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. Alright. Cool. Thanks, Simon. I appreciate your time.
