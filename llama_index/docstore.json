I can hear you. Good.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Fantastic. Cool, man. Sorry. You guys been good? Had a good weekend?\nSpeaker 1: Doing good. Yeah. Yeah.

And Rodrigo. Prodigal. Yes. Prodigal. That's fine. Alright. Cool. Yeah. Last thing I wanna do is mess up the names right at the beginning. But yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no worries. No worries about that.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. So I was looking forward to the call. I really wanted to see how we could potentially help you guys out. If you open to it, I can get us started with this entire process if you'd like.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let let's do it. We are also, you know, intrigue on on where your services are, what is exactly that you do. So go ahead. We we'd love to to hear it.\nSpeaker 0: Amazing. So how the calls usually go with very simple. I just want to start off by asking some quick questions, help me understand where you guys are at, where you want to be, and if we could potentially help you get there, And then, obviously, if you seem like a good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer in a ton of detail and then, you know, answer any questions that you might have, then we can go from there. Is that okay with you guys?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Sounds good. Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Amazing. So best place to start. What made you wanna schedule the call in the first place?\nSpeaker 1: Right. So, I guess, as usual or as most of your clients, we wanna grow our our, let's say, our sales necessarily the amount of clients. We actually wanna, you know, grow our our average ticket to us to call it, let's say. We wanna start basically charging more for our services because we know, like, we can do that, especially if we get more clients from the US or Europe. As you know, we are based in Argentina and Well, you know, clients local clients at least don't usually have enough money to cover, you know, international fees. So The idea is to to try and grow a little more outside the country. And that way, we can get, you know, better and higher fees, basically.\nSpeaker 0: Hundred percent That's amazing. So increasing your pricing, increasing your ticket size by going after international brands as opposed to just staying in Argentina, so going after US, Europe.\nSpeaker 1: That's right.\nSpeaker 0: That ones like those.\nSpeaker 1: That's right. We currently are working with a couple brands in in Spain, specifically, and the US. But yeah, it's not yet significant in our, you know, monthly ticket, let's say, or yearly ticket. So that that's why we we wanna grow it.\nSpeaker 0: That's perfect. And we've had a ton of clients who come on in the exact same situation. So let's actually get a number on it. Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna grow too?\nSpeaker 1: Right. So, basically, at least in my case, I I I don't like to to set, you know, goals in in such a specific way. Basically, what I wanna get to is I wanna try and see, you know, as a first step because this is this would be a and absolute first step for us. I wanna try and see if we can get at least one client to change in the short term in the next month. With a set pricing we've defined, which is eighteen hundred dollars a month for social media and Google Ads.

But I just wanna start with one just to, you know, make sure that that the model works and that they actually are people out there are willing to pay for that. Yeah. So yeah. But that's that's basically I I like to focus on the the immediate short term instead of, you know, planning so long ahead.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Hundred percent. Just get the first wins and then talk about the major goals after that?\nSpeaker 1: That's right. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So just just so I know on the same page, you said one client signed in the next month at one thousand eight hundred per month?\nSpeaker 1: At least. Yeah. Yeah. Because that'll be ideal.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That should be very, very doable. How much are you charging right now?\nSpeaker 1: So right now, just so you get an idea, you know, we started about three years ago. And we've had, you know, all kinds of clients, you know, we have some clients we we actually started with at the very beginning. You know, others have come and gone throughout the way. And our structure right now, basically, we have eight fixed monthly clients and then a couple that just come and go with, you know, one time things like websites or whatever. And we're bringing in about fifty five hundred dollars a month with those paid clients. So, basically, like, in an ideal world, if we could swap those eight clients for this eighteen hundred a month -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: we would go considerably up. Say, yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean, I think we we all know that it's definitely possible to be charging a higher, you know, for our clients to work with now, we don't recommend charging under three thousand at least. So okay. I mean, one thousand eight hundred, that's very, very doable. Out of curiosity, like, what's stopping you from just charging more right now from just raising your prices?\nSpeaker 1: Right. So to be honest, basically, we have not yet started, you know, you know, doing any kind of ads or or any kind of outreach strategy. We're we're kind of just waiting to see how to to move forward, basically. We are about to launch a new landing page on our website specifically, you know, directed to this kind of public or client type. But we don't know where to start it. If it is through our own ads, you know, become our own clients, sort of speak, or to just work with somebody else and partner up and try and find, you know, different ways to to get to clients, basically, and then convert leads So so that that's where we're standing, basically. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Cool. So you're not too sure whether you should do your own ads, get someone else to do it. And then -- Yeah. -- you go after the international clients, that's an important thing because locally, they might not be able to pay that much. But if you go after US, UK, Canada, paying three k, five k a month is pretty normal, honestly. Yeah. The same service as I do. Okay. Cool.\nSpeaker 1: That's good.\nSpeaker 0: So, yeah, I don't have eight clients now in total. Let's bring you in around five thousand five hundred per month.\nSpeaker 1: That's right. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. And let's say, I know you don't wanna put the exact number on it. But in the ideal world, you're able to be signing clients predictably, internationally. Do you have any sort of monthly figure that you'd like to hit?\nSpeaker 1: So honestly, as I said before, I I don't like to to said, you know, specific goals in the long term. The the one thing I'm, you know, most, let's say, quote unquote, worried about is how many clients we can", "doc_id": "90bf3686-4fcd-4e99-8a4a-3814975c18b2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5b12ff6e4e7b91a2f05346106e3f3d5dafcbfc4c180ed30f6cb6283f97d15f7f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3559, "end": 7339, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54f6e547-b840-4a89-81ad-8acb875e03a7", "2": "6f3b340e-b05c-4451-aef4-fcccbe4eefe1", "3": "beb0cff5-818d-453a-8962-a7a7ea40fe3d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "beb0cff5-818d-453a-8962-a7a7ea40fe3d": {"__data__": {"text": "let's say, quote unquote, worried about is how many clients we can actually work with at at the size team we are right now. I know we can, you know, we could easily double insights right now. You know, we can go to to ten clients or to sixteen clients. No worries. But then it depends a lot on the on the type of clients and on the needs they have, you know, at the same let's say, kinds of services. There's different levels of of demand the client might have. So, again, it's not it's not necessarily easy for us to to calculate it in in number of clients or or in an exact amount per month. You know, it depends on what comes about, I guess. But, you know, I'm I'm with the people we have right now, there's eight of us in total. I'm sure we can work with at least twenty clients for sure. And then, of course, we we would add that to whatever comes our way.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. That's what so you have eighteen members. So you definitely have capacity to take on a lot more clients, like you said, around two areas. And we charge at least two thousand for an extra twelve clients that's, like, an extra twenty four thousand per month at your current capacity. Which is great. Okay. Cool. So we know that, you know, you add around five thousand five hundred now. The goal is to sign more clients because you already have the capacity. Right? So it's the capacity already there. That's not a problem. We just need more people. We used to be speaking of people. So who actually is your ideal client?\nSpeaker 1: Right. So, basically, we work on on three different stages of brands, let's say, starting with, you know, people that just don't have anything set up yet, not even a brand name or logo or or any kind of, let's say, visual concept for their company. So they need everything from us. We'll start there and then we move on to website developments and as we call it digital assets. So all, you know, social media accounts and websites landing pages, you know, conversion funnels, everything. And then the final leg of the service would be, you know, marketing campaigns and automations and email marketing or kinds of communication efforts, let's say. And I would say, you know, the perfect line would be the one that covers all three stages, but we don't like to limit, you know, our services to them. You know, if somebody we've had a couple examples of people that come with really good branding, you know, material and they just need a website or sometimes they even come with a website that doesn't really perform that well, and then we'd help them you know, make it better or just add, you know, landing pages to it. So yeah. That's basically all of we can cover, but, you know, any kind of line within those areas would be fine.\nSpeaker 0: That makes a lot of sense. So you're able to do a lot of things So, like, the landing pages, the funnels, marketing campaigns. But for some clients only need a specific part of it. So you'll just offer that to them. But the ideal client would actually cover all three of the bases of your service because you can pro provide a lot more value. Chargeable?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Basically basically, that that's that's it. We we would provide a lot more value. We get to know the client better. They get to trust us more. To we would, of course, get higher fees with them because we'd be we'd be covering more. And in those specific cases, we we actually, you know, kind of become, like, an alternative to an an in house team.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: As that kind of, you know, makes at least in in my view, it's what makes more sense, let's say, or what what kind of gives us an idea or or kind of Azure says that that client is gonna stay with us for at least, you know, six months or a year.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You made such a good point there because the more integrated you are into the actual client, the more you're doing for them -- Yeah. -- or it's Like, it's a", "doc_id": "beb0cff5-818d-453a-8962-a7a7ea40fe3d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ab3594d61f916961ba622de1f9ee0a6dd06bc01bdce8d035ee4e08b249523885", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7343, "end": 11270, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54f6e547-b840-4a89-81ad-8acb875e03a7", "2": "90bf3686-4fcd-4e99-8a4a-3814975c18b2", "3": "4a958c1d-927a-4fad-aad2-ddb364fc6ecb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a958c1d-927a-4fad-aad2-ddb364fc6ecb": {"__data__": {"text": "the more you're doing for them -- Yeah. -- or it's Like, it's a sticky partnership because you're not just, like, agency that just did, like, a landing page. You're actually, like, fully integrated into their business. Which is ideal based on for much longer period of time. That's great. Mhmm. Okay. Cool. So To summarize that, I think we can determine that your ideal client wouldn't necessarily be the guy, you know, just starting out that just needs a website like desperately It's more so someone that has the budget, is already established, but can still benefit from all three components of your service. Because if you can do that, they'll stay for longer, you can provide more value, and you can charge a lot more. While not having to allocate resources towards, you know, the beginnings. Does that make sense?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It does. It does.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. Then I think that would be the ideal strategy. And then for sales, let's say we were to be able to, you know, generate a ton of leads who would actually be taking these calls.\nSpeaker 1: So in that case, it would be me at the beginning. And, yeah, if it's well, again, I I don't know, you know, what you're used to to generating monthly, but I guess I could easily get those calls. And then if I ever need some help, I can't get help. So it's not a problem. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: That's perfect. Okay. Cool. So just to recap everything, the goal is to go from, you know, fifty five hundred way or right now to I guess, hitting your capacity first. And I think that would be around an extra twenty, thirty thousand per month. Obviously, I can vary depending on the client size, but it'll be around that much. So adding an extra twenty, thirty k per month. And in order to do that, we're just gonna get you speaking to a lot more qualified prospects on a daily basis. Right? You have the foundations you have, the team, you have case studies you have results. All of that's already taken care of. You just need to be speaking to more of these people every single day. And if we can solve that one problem, then, I mean, scale will be pretty much straightforward. Is anything I missed there?\nSpeaker 1: Good. No. So, basically, again, just to be completely honest, The one thing we are not that, you know, strong one at least for now is we we don't have really solid case studies that say to to basically sell to a bigger or medium sized company based in the US. You know? They I know they expect,\nSpeaker 0: you know,\nSpeaker 1: you know, people like us to show, like, really good results and and and, you know, to prove how much value we add. And, basically, we do have a couple success stories, but nothing that really amounts to,\nSpeaker 0: you\nSpeaker 1: know, touching three thousand or eighteen hundred even a month. Mhmm. So that's got a difficult thing for us to to work through at least now, but I'm sure we can. I mean, again, it depends a little on on who's on the other side if it's So that's why, you know, I said before we were we might be inclined to work with smaller companies or upcoming companies more than, you know, big players. But then again, it depends a lot on, as I said, who's on the other side and how much they want us to prove. Basically, our our strongest site right now is website design, basically, and functionality and automations and integrations with different tools.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: So, basically, that that's what all the best thing we have to show at least right now.\nSpeaker 0: Got it. And it's a very, I wanna say, self aware thing to say because it is true that these companies do expect a lot in terms of having past results. So -- Yep. -- we've had clients in the past who came on with minimal case studies. And I can share how we'd recommend moving forward because, like, in the situation. But just so", "doc_id": "4a958c1d-927a-4fad-aad2-ddb364fc6ecb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "22b4eff8432c0de23c3bf3b340e8a2138d229e4aba273694eb366a10d11f713f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11276, "end": 15109, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "54f6e547-b840-4a89-81ad-8acb875e03a7", "2": "beb0cff5-818d-453a-8962-a7a7ea40fe3d", "3": "f07a1fdd-dc04-45a0-a8fa-965bc232dff0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f07a1fdd-dc04-45a0-a8fa-965bc232dff0": {"__data__": {"text": "share how we'd recommend moving forward because, like, in the situation. But just so that I can get an idea of it and provide the best feedback, the outcomes of your case studies right now, are there any sort of tangible outcomes like increase in speed, increase in sales, increase in conversions, anything to this degree that you can actually measure?\nSpeaker 1: Or yes? Yes. All of them, you know, show, you know, growth or success at least on on the first objectives that were, you know, defined with the client. But the thing is they Like, most of them don't really amount to that much money at least, you know, have it work with people in in Argentina. If you, you know, bring that to to a US or Canada scale or, you know, something Europeans might be used to, it looks like it's just ten cents a dollar, you know.\nSpeaker 0: So the only case of study we have is Skype for Moli.\nSpeaker 1: But Yeah. So that's right. What what are the best so that that's a great example. One of the best case studies we have or success stories is a a German, Argentinian company that provides services for farmers. Front land, let's say, basically, what what what they've developed is a an app that works with satellites and, you know, blueprints from farmers that lets them know, you know, when to let's say, what what's the name of this? When the plant sees how much product to use or whatever, some some things like that. Basically, what we achieved is an an extra amount of monthly downloads of that app through iOS. But then that, you know, that doesn't really does didn't really bring in a direct. Yeah. Commercial, let's say, result to the company. For now, it's just downloads. It doesn't really we kinda really measure it in in money, but, you know, it's something pretty interesting mainly because they were working with a a another sizing company facing Germany before when they were, you know, investing almost ten times what we were investing. And we are investing now, let's say, and and we're getting, you know, twice as many leads and twice as many downloads a month. So that's something interesting to to show.\nSpeaker 0: That's great. Yeah. Okay. Cool. I appreciate you sharing that. And based on that and the current size of the business, I don't think we'd be able to help you directly in terms of what we do in terms of the done for you growth partnership. And I'll share why, and then I'll share what I'd recommend moving forward, and I can answer any questions that you might have. But the reason why initially, at least at this point. It's just because of the size of the company in terms of, you know, revenue amount and then the case studies as well. So the main one is or the first one is the revenue. For example, our fees are probably around five thousand nine hundred per month. So it drastically eaten into the actual revenue. And it's not the best state to be in, you know, us taking, like, all the new, it's messes with you in terms of thinking, and then the case studies as well. So what we look for always is very tangible, very outcome based, revenue based case studies that we can leverage in the actual marketing to book these calls. So Based on what you told me though, what I'd recommend is I definitely think you have the capabilities of charging a lot more now. I don't think you need to wait to be able to increase your prices. I think and this is from speaking to Asian sellers every single day. What we realize is it's less important what you do, but it's more important who you do it for. Right? So you can decide to work with the beginners, the people just starting out, they just need a website, they've never done business before, and they're figuring everything else out and they have no money. And you can charge a thousand dollars. Or you could work with a massive company, Fortune five hundred company, do the exact same thing. But charge a hundred times more. Yes. I think the first thing that you could do to grasically increase things is change who you're talking.

That's right.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm I'm sorry that we can't help you out on this. But do you have any questions personally?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no worries. Yeah. It's very clear. We we've actually, you know, talked with a couple, you know, competitors of yours and say, and they all come down to the same conclusion. So it makes sense, you know, of course, if it makes sense.

I started, like, my my agency three months ago.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: So it's pretty new. We got a client now and a few possible clients in the upcoming weeks.\nSpeaker 0: Congratulations. And\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And, yeah, we we just we just want to to get clients and and train with the calls and everything. So we can we can scale our business and start to automate everything and and just, yeah, get new clients.\nSpeaker 0: So how do you currently go about getting clients?\nSpeaker 1: Right now, I'm doing cold email outreach. I'm also doing some Like, I'm conducting prospects through email, through Instagram, through LinkedIn, and a bunch of cold calling too, but it didn't go that well. So I stopped for a while. And, yep, that's pretty much it. Right now, I'm doing a manual outreach, so I'm sending everything myself because I like to personalize everything for for the clients. But in the future, we'll surely automate everything and focus on on the the calls.\nSpeaker 0: So would it be fair to say that right now in your business, getting clients, getting meetings is the biggest bottleneck right now?\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. Correct. So correct me if I'm wrong, but you saw paid advertisement. Right? Mhmm. And how much do you charge for that?\nSpeaker 1: It depends on how much on the ad ad's been budget of the of the client. Basically, what we did was we have, like, three pricing methods. One for like, one if the clients want to spend between one k and six k per month, which charge them five sixty nine dollars and fifteen percent performance fee. Then if they want to up their Hudson budget between six k and twenty k. It's nineteen hundred dollars plus ten percent performance fee. And if they want to spend more than twenty k, it's four thousand dollars plus five percent performance fee. Because at that point, will take more from the performance even from the base fee.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So the clients you look for are ones with higher budgets.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It it's possible. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So We're gonna take a Yeah. We're gonna take\nSpeaker 1: a all all kind of price, like, small medium and big. Right now, we have just a small client, but we we surely want to we're contacting, like, more", "doc_id": "0659d765-6004-438b-b0a7-b34259c2cdfe", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ded4d84639e613d796f11bfe4e81feb5a4f63c49867a3154061dcf4b902a4d9c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3635, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "2baa623e-945b-46f5-b83d-0ddf3c56f3a7", "3": "8024d8fd-1a62-42fb-ac83-701d17f63368"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "8024d8fd-1a62-42fb-ac83-701d17f63368": {"__data__": {"text": "just a small client, but we we surely want to we're contacting, like, more whale clients.

Are you a client? Would be already established brand that already ran at, if possible. But want to focus on something else, so they just want to delegate the whole paid traffic service. So yeah. So times that span at least seven eight k a month and that's been something like this. Mhmm. And and, yeah, just online stores, e commerce stores, and info product businesses.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. And can you walk me through your sales process?\nSpeaker 1: Like, the calls with with the client.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. The process from taking someone from a complete stranger to a bank client today.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So first of all, we send them a an email or d we could take them, like, from LinkedIn, something like this. And we tried to to sell the meeting, so they can agree to go on a first call with us. If they agree, we cannot do, like, the same here just like, a first date call, see if it'd be a good feed, ask some questions and everything. And if we'll be a good fit, we just schedule a second call with the the CMO also, and we just go through through the numbers, the pricing, what we can really do and etcetera. And if they agree after that, just they they just go through the onboarding process. And and that's it.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So now we just wanna know your process for doing outreach and forgetting clients in the past. You said a lot of cold messaging, didn't really like the cold calling. What else have you\nSpeaker 1: done now? We tried okay. We tried five things five different things. A lot of email outreach that we're still doing, a lot of Instagram DMs, a lot of LinkedIn connections, So, yeah, the cold calling that we stopped, like, two weeks ago, but we might we might go on again and a bit of of of work outreach. Oh, yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So do you have a process in place to get customers? Or system like this.\nSpeaker 1: What what do you mean?\nSpeaker 0: You just have a how can I say a predictable process for getting meetings?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Okay. Like, if I send that that much email, that the percentage of meetings I can book for meetings?\nSpeaker 0: Exactly that. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Basically, we we have, like, this email tracker for the open reply and meetings book rates. We saw call that for about a a hundred and fifty emails that we send. We booked around yeah, not that much, like, one or two meetings. Yeah. So we have to to improve on that.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So you're gonna improve. You're gonna get that numbers. Right?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. We we have a a good open rate, like, something sixty five, thirty percent. We have pretty decent reply rates. That is let me see. Yeah. That is okay. Like, seventeen percent. And from the people replying, we got, like, two percent or, like yeah. Two percent of people actually be booking a meeting. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And thanks for telling me the info. So now I just wanna figure out exactly where you are with a metric and where you wanna be in the future. So how much money are you currently making per month for this business?\nSpeaker 1: Right now, just with the one client, we're making around fifteen fifteen hundred dollars a month. And yeah. So I've got a whole business road map right here. You want to get at least, like, four or five clients for the end of April, and we're aiming for ten clients for December. That's what we are aiming for.\nSpeaker 0: That's cool.

What's your motivation for getting to twenty five k?\nSpeaker 1: I have working. Twenty four seven and just out bridge all the time to get clients and train for calls.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: And then hire more people.\nSpeaker 0: So you wanna automate some of this stuff?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. For sure. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: So how would the business actually change if you got the twenty five k a month?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, well, firstly, right now, we're, like, four in the in the agency for myself. Facebook and Google Ads Manager, creative and video designer for the ads, and lead generation that brings me lead every week. And, yeah, twelve months, what would change would be great to have, like, company of maybe eight, nine people so we can handle all the clients focused on the customer care and automate everything and just scale and choose our own clients if possible.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: That would that would be great. Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So you work with, like, in most qualified prospects, not just anyone.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Yeah. Right now, we're we're not taking anyone, but we're not really ending on the quality of the prospects. There there have to be, like, they have to to spend at least, like, two, three k a month on on ad spend and just be a non night store, and and that's it. But in the future, if we can choose, like, where clients and everything, if we would be would be awesome.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. And what type of Is there any specific niche that you want in the future?\nSpeaker 1: Well, right now, we're doing all kinds of we're doing like fashion brands. We're doing cosmetic brands, jewelry brands. And I think that's it. But maybe in the future, we'll we'll just focus on one niche that might probably be, I don't know, between fashion and cosmetics. I I don't know.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. In the future, you'll have the choice So last last one, how would twenty five k, you know, have an impact on you specifically?\nSpeaker 1: Like, on my on my cell phone on personal basis?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Personal.\nSpeaker 1: Well, it's a huge impact because right now, I'm I'm living in in this small small apartments in Spain. And I just want to to like, travel the world. That's the only thing I wanna do. Go to to Australia. And yeah. I just need the need the money to do that. And then set up for a bigger bigger house, bigger apartments and -- Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: and start things from there.\nSpeaker 0: Have a Australia readiness?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Just\nSpeaker 0: keep that in mind.\nSpeaker 1: Australia is, like, major country to go. That's like that's one of the main reasons I added this business is just to travel.\nSpeaker 0: Really?\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: That's nice. That's really nice. So you're currently at one five one thousand five hundred dollars per month. You wanna get twenty five k? What do you think stopping you from? Calendar on your own?\nSpeaker 1: I don't think anything is stopping me right now, but I just have to to keep being consistent and just to try different things with the outreach and maybe in twelve months, I'll get to it. But, yeah, patience and consistency, I think, are, like, the the key points for me getting there. Just something to do to to work every day.\nSpeaker 0: So you're comfortable with getting that job?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I like working. But if I can maybe focus focus on something because Outreach is taking me eighty percent of of my day.

That makes sense. So you're currently making one thousand five hundred. Why not just continue what you're doing? Stay where you are.\nSpeaker 1: That's enough. That's just not enough. I'll do to do more and be here.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I see. When you're actually looking to, you know, start taking on more clients,\nSpeaker 1: Sorry?\nSpeaker 0: When do you actually want to start taking on new clients every more meeting today?\nSpeaker 1: As as soon as possible. K.\nSpeaker 0: Based on your answers, based on what you told me, based on where you want to be, I have a lot of confidence that I think I can help you with this. Would you like me to briefly explain what I do, then you can ask any questions that you might know?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. For sure.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So as you might know, our area of expertise is in helping agency owners to get a lot more clients by filling the calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agents that we work with, they're just starting out usually between zero and eight k per month. With a goal of getting to around twenty to fifty k. Typically, these owners are doing everything in the business themselves, outreach service delivery sales, And their main goal is usually to free up a lot of time and take more of an ownership role to stop working in the business but to work on the business. They usually look into a high ticket. Typically, e commerce clients, the ones with high budgets that can spend a lot. That's what they're looking for. And, yeah, based on what you told me, it seems like it'd be a great foot for what we do. Love to hear what you think.\nSpeaker 1: Well, it could be really great. But it all it depends on on the budget, of course. Because I'm I'm having, like, fifteen hundred dollars a month, but a lot of that I'm just reinvesting and putting in in my team and on the on the outreach and keeping a little bit. So depends on budget.\nSpeaker 0: So you'd like to know the pricing?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let me take it.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So Our fee for building and managing the system is a one time setup fee of fifteen hundred dollars and then from the it's only one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. So one thousand five hundred dollars for for WAN exactly. Like, what do you do with that?\nSpeaker 0: The setup, please?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So firstly, it goes into all the costs associated with running your account, like the software's the account manager, the niche research, the lead sourcing, etcetera. Yeah. Pretty much just a cost associated with running your account?\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm. Okay. And then from that, every call that I get it's a hundred dollars.\nSpeaker 0: Every qualified prospect that shows up. So only prospects that meet your criteria that actually come to the meeting.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Interesting. Yeah. This would be doable, I think. I'll just have to to talk a bit with my team, but yeah. Maybe with my team more.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Would your CMO be opposed to moving forward?\nSpeaker 1: No. No. Just to to keep him accountable of of the call and and just to talk about this with him and I'm pretty sure he felt happy. Mhmm. But just to so I I don't do everything long.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, sure. No. Totally. It makes sense. Just out of curiosity, does he know Sorry. I think I cut out there. Mhmm. What was that saying?\nSpeaker 1: Like, that's you know?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, oh, yeah. Yeah. Doesn't know you're coming on this call today or that you came on the call today?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah.

Are you saying that you are on board and ready to move forward and you just need to get a yes from him or are there some doubts elsewhere?\nSpeaker 1: From my end, it would be, like, there's a of course, there's a couple of doubts because I'm putting, like, my money online. But from my end, I would be willing to risk it. I mean, I'll I'll just speak with the others and and on Monday, I'll I'll tell you if we're good or not. That's it.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. Because this is if there's any doubts, you know, we're right we're here with each other right now. I'd be happy to answer any questions or clarify anything for you.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Because, like, fifteen hundred dollars is not that much. But for my starting agency, it's like, So it's like fifty percent of the revenue we have. So that's a bit of money. But if this works, like, how how many how many clients do you can I have no how many quality leads that show to meetings can you provide per month with this?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. That's a good question. And one that gets asked almost every call, So as you know, everyone's different. I can't guarantee anything, but what I've seen on average is ten to twenty meetings per month. In the first one to two months is a ramp up process. This is just to keep everything all your accounts safe and everything when we do outreach. But on average, when it stabilizes ten to twenty and then that can be scaled up limitlessly.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. And does your price does your price always stay the same or does it scale also with the clients we're having?\nSpeaker 0: It stays the same at one hundred dollars per appointment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. That's pretty good. So, yeah, I'm pretty confident we'll be working with you. But, yeah, as I said, I just have to to notify everyone and and I'll speak to you on Monday about it.\nSpeaker 0: That sounds great. That's great speaking to you. Do you have any further questions? I don't have to answer anything.\nSpeaker 1: Let me see. I don't think so. Yeah. Like, when do we pay you? Yeah. How many Like, how many days or weeks do I start getting my first calls?\nSpeaker 0: Good question. So the first week will pretty much be designated to can you are getting onboarded, fast to get understanding of your ideal target, ideal niche, then we'll be sourcing everything. So the first week, that'll be designated to onboarding. And from there, we'll start sending messages. So --\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: -- within the first twenty one days, we'll be doing outreach. First fourteen days even.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And what kind of I don't know if I you can answer answer this. What what kind of outbridge will you do?\nSpeaker 0: We use a combination of cold email and LinkedIn.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. I clicked in self navigator. Yes. Okay. Okay. Well, that I I don't think I have further questions.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. So I can schedule the call for Monday, same time?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.

No. No. I was saying so thanks for thanks for having this call. So I have, of course, two questions, but I guess Do you want me to start kind of describing literally, you know, two minutes, what we are, what we do, and what we're looking for? Would that would that make sense? Or it's as as you prefer. So\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. So I'll just give some context how the calls usually go. I just wanna start off by asking some quick questions. Up to that, you know, where you are where you wanna be. And if, obviously, we can help you get there. Obviously, if you seem like a good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, you know, how it works and we can go from there. Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That's perfect. Absolutely.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Amazing. So, Adriana, what made you wanna take the call in the first place?\nSpeaker 1: We are so the the reason is we are relatively small agency. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: They just\nSpeaker 1: give an idea. So we we are about thirty people We have offices in the UK and in the US. And we primarily work in b to b space. So we are not a b to c agency, but we are in b to b. And we like to say that we are a growth agency in the demand space for B2B. We are relatively small thirty people, let's say, twenty ish in Europe, so UK, and then ten in the in the We are kind of at two point five million dollars three million dollars annual business. So let's say, two hundred, two hundred and k ish, two hundred and fifty k, sorry, a month of business. Our business and I come to the point to your point, but I guess this kind of small introduction is is important. So In terms of our business, Europe and U. S. Europe, let's say, sixty percent of the business and forty percent U. S. Very different segments that we target. In Europe, we target primarily enterprise customers in sectors like IT, technology, and we have some big names. Always like relatively small projects, but kind of, you know, big name in the tech because we were born. We tech, our first client. I was in there at the time, but our first client was HP. Mhmm. So we have still many clients in the tech business. Tech business, FinTech, particularly with we're finance, mid needs technology. So we have several clients there. And then also but I would say this is more by accident. We have some customers also in manufacturing, which is not necessarily a segments that we proactively target, but we have, you know, five or six lines in manufacture. That's Europe. US is completely different. US is primarily SMB business and SaaS company, software as a service, primarily on a on a kind of retainer base. So, I don't know, ten k customers that give us the the the keys of the marketing house And it's basically, you know, ten, fifteen, whatever, k per month. In Europe, it's we don't we don't work much on on retailers, so it's it's much more on kind of project phase kind of the traditional type of agency business. Why we're having this conversation? Because finally, I get your point to your", "doc_id": "95693a25-389e-4123-a582-28c8b18e52f9", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6d5f4c9f91ab50c888b31e4dab2f7ad5901a409d1524906a0a44f06833f08960", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3752, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb4e1f86-7c94-4a9a-a7e1-70f1ba920c96", "3": "831ad046-62a3-4bda-b63d-fa7e6a5619e8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "831ad046-62a3-4bda-b63d-fa7e6a5619e8": {"__data__": {"text": "Why we're having this conversation? Because finally, I get your point to your question. We are small. We don't have sophisticated business development. We have nobody doing business development. I am in charge of the enterprise business in Europe. And then I have a a fellow who is in charge of the of the of the of the business in the US, and we all report to the and we both report to the managing director. No one is doing business development. Right? So the way we sign clients is I guess, you mentioned that in one of your videos. Right? The the way we send clients is primarily through personal networks, I've worked in the tech business for years in, you know, IBM and NSP and so on. So I know the tech business a little bit. Some kind of personal networks, referrals, but maybe maybe. We might have a a sales development rep from a partner agency that's gonna help us, you know, kind of doing the the outreach. But that's all. So we have nothing near, let's say, a systematic business development activity. So I guess that's a very long answer to your first questions, but I guess the next questions will be the the next answer will be much shorter actually.\nSpeaker 0: Hundred percent. And I really appreciate it. It gave so much useful context. He probably answered sixty percent of the questions that I usually have. So That's perfect. So just to recap everything and correct me if I'm wrong. You have around thirty people right now working for the agency, twenty in Europe, ten in US. News more towards enterprise IT, fintech. You've worked with big names in the past, so you have, you know, ton of establishment already. The U. S. Is more focused on SMB, SaaS, primarily on retainer basis, ten to fifteen k a month, mainly on project basis. Would that be correct?\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent correct and probably an important point, I guess, for the for the for the turnaround for this conversation is that it might sound odd, but I would say that the the the US is not necessarily kind of keen to get tons of new business because they're saying, you know, we are ten here, ten ish. Let's say we are small. Our creative team is is here in the UK. Everything is here in the UK. We basically help them. So they don't have the bandwidth for the time being, for example, to take ten new clients. Of course, getting ten new clients, they will kind of get to the team will need to get, you know, to the next level in terms of skills, resources, and so on. So I'm not saying that they don't want new business. But they don't want, you know, volumes of new businesses because they they they believe and this is never end discussions, but they believe that they cannot handle. In on the contrary, in Europe, we are definitely looking for new business in a kind of more systematic way as I said.\nSpeaker 0: That's amazing. So the UK is I mean, the US isn't necessarily keen on getting huge influxes of new business, you know, constantly because they don't believe that they have the bandwidth. But on the other side, the EU, the Europe is able to take on more clients systematically?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Definitely. And we can scale up and down because within the last three years, we were able to scale up, three large clients, scale up quickly clients, you know, then kind of sunset of some of the big clients, so scaled down. So we we are relatively agile to do that here in Europe.\nSpeaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. So Right now, the agencies at around two hundred and fifty thousand per month. What's your goal?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I think we can definitely at least double it in the next twelve months. I think that I believe that we have the skills and the offers. And then, of course, we can referring to your video. We have the author to get to that. It's just a question again on, you know, being noticed, getting noticed. And again, kind of, you know, we we tend to do I've been here now for eighteen months. Right? I came from a larger agency.

I came from a larger agency. And the the reason I joined is that these agencies of creation has brilliant ideas. Right? Bright people very focused on technology and innovation, you know, the use of technology now in in doing marketing, for example. But again, kind of we we we are small, sometimes, you know, more kind of freelancer type of things, you know, ten ideas per minute. But then, you know, you need to kind of operationalize all this and then, you know, run a cruise speed. Otherwise, you know, the ups and downs then are not are not good for the business. So\nSpeaker 0: Makes a lot of sense. So you guys definitely have a a great team behind you. Including your tech background already, which is amazing. So you wanna go from two hundred and fifty thousand per month to five hundred thousand per month. And the only thing stop you from getting there is just signing more of the clients that you wanna work with.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It it's it's signing more and really pitching pitching. I don't like to work pitch. Having business conversations with clients because in again, that that's why I say that that our offer is is relatively good because when we get the chance, when we have the chance to talk to to clients, we sign in the summer. Because because, again, you know, we have a client of a network. It's probably more in deep as well. We have a breadth really kind of a large portfolio of services. And we can work on small project, large projects, we can work on branding, so kind of more developing content or kind of taking existing content and make them usable, snackable, more digestible, I would say then to run, for example, demand gen or media campaigns. And then we have an account based marketing engine, you know, that allow us to say, okay, so very, very targeted kind of account based and individual based media campaigns that brings a return, let's say, higher than the average return on investment. And also, we have developed recently a kind of a a something we are pushing with our prospects a reward for good offering blockchain based that basically is, you know, attend the webinar or download this. White paper and then you can decide then how to use some credits offset your carbon footprint, you know, plant trees, remove plastic from the oceans, and then you get and if once you do that, you get NFVs. And so that's that's basically in a nutshell the offering that we have developed. And this is working relatively well, so here in both in Europe and in the US.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, man. That's amazing. So it really is the case that you just need more productive business conversations because you have an offer that's proven to convert. If you can just have the conversations, there's a very high likelihood that they'll sign up just because of the flexibility of your offer. That you can work with large projects, small ones, whatever they can benefit from. Right? Right.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And we have in the in the areas that I mentioned before. And I I if you had a look at on our website, by the way, we are kind of rebuilding it and it should be life any day soon. But we have some good case studies. In our case studies work on, you know, brands, so more kind of developing the overall value proposition and then creatives for a brand or for a solution or for a products or kind of the traditional agency exercise more in the awareness space. But we have, again, good good case that is also in account based marketing campaign that delivered higher return on investment for several clients. So That's why I say, we walk the talk. So we say, we believe that we have a very good ABM offering. Here it is. Right? This is what we did or two or three customers, saying we have a good creative team -- Mhmm. -- based here in the UK, because that's sometimes a concern with some European customers and say, oh, yeah. But, you know, so you create a team in the US so that they don't understand Europe and so on, so creative team is here. In Europe, we are born in Europe. So, yeah, it's it's just a question of, you know, getting the word out.\nSpeaker 0: Hundred percent.", "doc_id": "70d09273-93dd-46fd-b61e-642935d105cd", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "62c3bd1dc637c72d9ede23c1d9cf75e79628fe8652f08357d27c6cbf03c946ba", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7692, "end": 11804, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb4e1f86-7c94-4a9a-a7e1-70f1ba920c96", "2": "831ad046-62a3-4bda-b63d-fa7e6a5619e8", "3": "2da0ae49-6efa-4b96-bce5-fabbcbc1b7e5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "2da0ae49-6efa-4b96-bce5-fabbcbc1b7e5": {"__data__": {"text": "question of, you know, getting the word out.\nSpeaker 0: Hundred percent. That's honestly fantastic. It generally sounds like you have everything that you need in order to convert and get noticed by these prospects. You have everything you need in order to do that. So that leads on to the next point on Who exactly do you want to work with? Obviously, you mentioned a a couple of different industries, but what would be the ideal one for you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So in I I I speak for the enterprise business here in here in Europe. If I have to if I have to run a kind of a systematic business development, the activity or demand generations campaign, and I would primarily target three segments. The first one is startups. And with startups here, you you know, that you can get some some list from excuse me. You can get some list from data provider that gives you basically the list of well, these are the list of, you know, three hundred companies that raised funds from VCs and so on in the last I don't know, six months. Right? Mhmm. And they are somehow likely to to outsource, for example, whom marketing function or, you know, some specific demand gen or the branding and this kind of thing. So I think startups in Europe -- Mhmm. -- is segments. I know that it's relatively large. But when I say startup is basically startup in technology, let's say, and fintech, which is still large. But, you know, that's that's, I would say, the first segment. The other one is the IT security market. In Europe is globally. But if we just stay here in Europe, it's very large and growing. And we are not getting any fair share of that in terms of a marketing agency. Yes, we heard in the past a couple of IT security companies, global ones. And again, I think that there is a I would say significant opportunity to target those companies, especially, let's say, not not the kind of the global large ones you know, they they the the checkbox, the zscaler, or these kind of things. But probably, again, IT security company, and security is huge. IT's gonna security company born in Europe, and they're proud to be, you know, we are not large, you know, corporations. We are European companies. We know Europe with all kind of all the you know, the the the the peculiarities actually of Europe. And therefore, you know, we want to work with European partners in, you know, or brand or for demand generation. So IT security could be a second target. And then I guess that the third one is, I know probably it's not the best moment to do that. But I would say the the kind of the fintech slash crypto segment, especially in the UK, we had worked with a couple of crypto companies in the last twelve months, again, account based account based marketing campaign. I think that again, probably you know, crypto is a little bit volatile, has in terms of, you know, focus and growth and so on. But I think that's probably, you know, another another segment that I've focused on. So start ups in Europe especially in tech, IT security, and and then fintech slash crypto. I would say primarily in the UK, eventually in Europe, but I think UK is the primary target.\nSpeaker 0: Amazing. Amazing. So startups in Europe, IT security, and fintech slash crypto. Yeah. So perfect. And I guess, at this point, the goal will be to get you in contact with more of these companies. Right? So you can have the productive business conversations, convert them into clients. And in terms of your sales process, would you be taking these calls or would it be someone else in team?\nSpeaker 1: Is primarily me. Then when we see that that there is a a kind of a specific interest also in the kind of in the reward for good offer that I mentioned before. Also, Jason, our managing director can attend because he is the one who really kind of, you know, created this offer. And it's his baby and so on. But let's say in in a hundred percent of the case, I will be on the on the phone or on Zoom meetings. And then eventually for a part of those, I can have Jason with me. But yeah.\nSpeaker 0:", "doc_id": "2da0ae49-6efa-4b96-bce5-fabbcbc1b7e5", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "ce25f1dafc44b5aa1df9d223a1b2b1d1288891a8421be20a7742a7249ca0917e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11805, "end": 15859, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb4e1f86-7c94-4a9a-a7e1-70f1ba920c96", "2": "70d09273-93dd-46fd-b61e-642935d105cd", "3": "7a71064f-da84-43c5-8cb9-5e87841c0836"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7a71064f-da84-43c5-8cb9-5e87841c0836": {"__data__": {"text": "a part of those, I can have Jason with me. But yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Fantastic. The reason I ask is just to make sure you guys have the capacity to take on, you know, whatever the influx, of course, maybe. But it seems that you have everything covered on that end. Correct?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And also, then again, we we have in our team. We have a couple of people that We have one expert also in the tech business. We have one in tech that has worked with all the fintech and financial markets clients. So eventually, those are people that can have, you know, conversations with clients as well.\nSpeaker 0: So that's amazing. Alright. Cool. So, I mean, just to recap what we spoke about so far, you're currently at around two hundred and fifty thousand per month. The goal is to get to five hundred thousand per month doubling. And the only thing stopping you from going from two fifty to five hundred is just signing more qualified clients. Right? So startups in in Europe, IT security, fintech slash crypto. If you can sign more of them, scale will be pretty much inevitable. So the only thing stopping you from signing clients is just having more productive conversations with them. Getting noticed, getting on to calls with them, and converting them because, generally, it seems like you have everything ready. In terms of, firstly, your background text, so you have a great understanding of it. But you also have, you know, a case that it was HP. You have other amazing case that it's too. And I definitely think you'll be able to convert them just based on your offer. So it really is just a matter of getting you in contact with these prospects. Would that sound reasonably close to your situation?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's it's very close to the situation and and, at an additional point also is that we only have internal teams. So we do not outsource. The only thing that we outsource and we always say this upfront because we don't have those those, let's say, skills in house is that sales development rather. So if there are customers that there are very, very few, but it happened with three or four. If there are customers that say, no. No. No. No. I want of course, this is a this is a demand generation of things. I want leads, but I don't want marketing leads. I want kind of type of appointments or band qualified leads. In this case, we work with some partner agencies that we'll do this kind of the this last mile of human qualification because we don't have those skills. You know, we work with many, you know, intact. Even when you were for a security company, you need to be subbing security to have conversation with your clients. The same time, our doing artificial intelligence. And so we we can't have a team of SDRs that are fluent you know, in in all possible sectors, industries, and technologies. So that's why I the it's the only I would say, team that is not asked. But for the rest, the data team, the martech team, the creative team, the media team, they're all in in house. And and this is something that client likes because it's a one stop shop. So, you know, We can do a Sunday campaign, for example, from from end to end. We work on the creative. We can work on the on the paid media advertising, media activation,\nSpeaker 0: reporting. So it's basically it's it's a one stop shop. Hundred percent. I I definitely think the clients will love the fact that it's the one stop shop. You can get, you know, everything that they need in one place. So That's another just amazing silent one. And one of the last things that I want to ask is, I know where you are. I know where you want to go. But have you guys tried anything in the past to try and attract clients just so that, you know, I have the full idea?\nSpeaker 1: Nothing I think by now, your guess that I like. I like the word systematically. Nothing systematically. I know that before I joined, this company tried to to do some, for example, attending events -- Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: buying,", "doc_id": "7a71064f-da84-43c5-8cb9-5e87841c0836", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d6552ae9ddb3fba03362986f0da40d0b48b869c2ebce6d973c2f27bbadcba5f9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15871, "end": 19858, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb4e1f86-7c94-4a9a-a7e1-70f1ba920c96", "2": "2da0ae49-6efa-4b96-bce5-fabbcbc1b7e5", "3": "7af9825b-6c2d-4094-a1e9-e1ae0a0cf5c3"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7af9825b-6c2d-4094-a1e9-e1ae0a0cf5c3": {"__data__": {"text": "events -- Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: buying, you know, kind of space at events, speaking opportunities, boots and so on, again, with our kind of managing director as a speaker. I think that we also tried. Again, I'm saying, I think because it's before I joined, sometimes it's speed dating as well that we're not kind of, you know, very successful, you know, speed dating when you you have fifteen minutes to, you know, present who you are and the value that you bring, and then you can have a follow-up and so on. But I get that's the only thing that that was done. Right. But nothing nothing more than that. So no. It's a Got it.\nSpeaker 0: So nothing systematic and that just leaves the fact that you guys are growing almost purely off of your network and referrals.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Also, when I joined since I, you know, I I know relatively well the world of tech I brought in also some, you know, tech tech clients, not not because I'm particularly good, but because you know, I I knew some companies. I knew what they were looking for in terms of marketing. And I said, you know, now I work for this agency. You know, if if you're interested, we can have a conversation. But of course, you know, that you cannot run a business only on personal network. Right? So because at some point. But first of all, the personal networks isn't really predictable. Yep. At a certain point, you know, it it kind of dries out. So you you can't you can't just run the business this, you know, this way. So\nSpeaker 0: -- Yeah. -- hundred percent. You only have so many friends. That's great.\nSpeaker 1: And also if you have good friends, you know, not not all of them might have projects, you know, all the time, you know, for YouTube. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. So in that case, just to summarize everything we spoke about, I mean, it seems like you genuinely have all the foundations ready. And the only thing stopping you from going from two hundred and fifty to five hundred thousand per month is just signing four clients. But signing these clients in a systematic, predictable method. Right? Because we don't want it to be sporadic, you know, all over the place like from personal networks. If we can just get you in contact with your ideal prospects of startups, IT security, fintech, predictably, and systematically, then I mean, scaling up pretty straightforward. And if that's the case, you're probably like ninety nine percent of our clients. So do you mind if I share what the next steps would be? Sure.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. So based on what you told me, genuinely, you seem like an amazing fit. And what we do is we help established marketing agencies to increase the revenue by fifty, one hundred, many cases, two to three hundred per month within six to nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right? They usually have everything that they need already sorted out. So they're usually growing from referrals, which just indicates a great service. They're usually great at what they do. They have the systems. They have smart team members. They have the case studies, they have everything we need to leverage, to help them get notice, to help them book meetings, to help them have you know, business conversations with the ideal prospects. And once we can solve this one problem, like, mainly just this one problem of getting them in contact with their ideal prospects, scale becomes inevitable. Right? Because it's it's quite straightforward. So based on that, would you be open to scheduling a follow-up or where I can create a customized proposal on exactly how we think we can help you reach five hundred k a month based on what you told me today?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And for for me, Anthony, what will be important is to understand. So how you do that? Not not asking you to share the kind of the the the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or", "doc_id": "7af9825b-6c2d-4094-a1e9-e1ae0a0cf5c3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f6404b3b20b80c5b27b19e65c7aafb4b53f3419d813f4968f8e7e468db26d085", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19868, "end": 23840, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "bb4e1f86-7c94-4a9a-a7e1-70f1ba920c96", "2": "7a71064f-da84-43c5-8cb9-5e87841c0836", "3": "07272835-4cf4-43d9-b848-5b0e5ec9dc3c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "07272835-4cf4-43d9-b848-5b0e5ec9dc3c": {"__data__": {"text": "the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or the the secret sauce or the recipe, but just say, okay.

And for some context, higher use of this proposal is to explain exactly that. So to give some context, we always start with going through, firstly, a ton of case studies. Just so you have an idea of who we've helped, what the outcomes they received work, then we go into our entire process where we explain start to finish exactly how we do what we do, and why it's different from every single other, you know, lead gen agency that offers similar things. And then into our pricing and additional details, how to get started, things like that. Would that be okay with you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That would be okay.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Right. Amazing. So in terms of booking tomorrow's call or the follow-up call. Would tomorrow at the same time as this call would be?\nSpeaker 1: Tomorrow is problematic, actually, because I'm off in the afternoon. Can we do it early next week? And then when you say very low?\nSpeaker 0: Course, what I'll do is I'll send over scheduling it. If it's mine, can you just let me know if any of these times worked here? And if so, we can book it in that way. If not, I'll move something around for you.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Then I'll I'll I'll I'll Let me have a look directly. So Yeah. No. I think should I book already? For Monday. Monday eleven CET, that's fine with me.\nSpeaker 0: If possible, yes. That would be great.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So okay. Okay. And Yep. Schedule.\nSpeaker 0: Amazing. Alright. I'm looking forward to it. And again, like I mentioned in this proposal call, will be going through our entire process, case studies, and all the other details that you'll need to know. And between now and them, either myself or someone else in the team will reach out just to confirm everything, make sure everything's okay, and we'll go from there. But I would love to It was great speaking to you. Very interesting to you.\nSpeaker 1: Why is ethan? Thanks thanks for your time and look look forward to our next discussion.\nSpeaker 0: Amazing.

Where are you based?\nSpeaker 1: Republic of Moldova, Eastern Europe.\nSpeaker 0: Republic of Moldova. Sounds nice.\nSpeaker 1: Correct? Yes. Indeed. Great.\nSpeaker 0: Otherwise, as a weekday?\nSpeaker 1: Always good. Always good.\nSpeaker 0: That's great. Yeah. Alright. Cool.\nSpeaker 1: Before we jump in to describing our model of business and what we have been working on all along. Could you please give us a small introduction how you actually help agencies grow?\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. And I just wanna make sure before we speak in, Irina, is that that correct?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes. Yes. That's that's that's right, Irina.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. Yeah. So Irina, to give a very quick overview of what we do, is we help establish marketing agencies to increase their revenue by fifty to one hundred k per month within around sixty nine months And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right? So usually, these agencies, they have all the foundations that they need already to scale. So they have the systems, they may have the team members, they may have posh results, they may have the ability to solve, They just are not speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day. And, you know, obviously, if we can get you in contact, with people that want what you're offering, that need what you're offering, and that you can help, and you can speak to them every single day, then scaling up and increasing revenue is pretty much inevitable. And the way these calls usually go is I really just wanna start off by asking you some quick questions help me understand where you are, where you wanna be, and if we could potentially help you get there. And then, obviously, if you see my good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works in a lot more detail. And then we can go from there. Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Yeah. So we're at team of four. And Currently, we have been working as an outsourced firm for a somebody based company. So we have been providing from content development to the website development creative and so on. In the means of financial, our biggest projects along the way were the annual reports across the relations field, which take place, like, for five to six months of implementation. So that's that. Few other projects were on the brand identity. So mostly we are focusing on creative and content creation for the business field. As well on the on lead acquisition. So we had an attempt last year same with the agency, and that didn't perform well. Mhmm. But considering the the the do circumstances right now, that the market is down. How quick we can get respondents into a contact so we can acquire a few links?\nSpeaker 0: How quickly would we be able to get you in contact with new leads?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Like, how how many weeks we are speaking of?\nSpeaker 0: That's a great question. So obviously, I mean, understand a bit more about who you're actually looking to get in contact with before I can actually give a time frame. But typically, how long it usually takes to get set up is within ten, fourteen days. That we can get things going and get you in contact with them. So just to recap what you said, you're a team of four right now. Yes. It's been working as an outsourced firm. Your main projects are in content, content creation, creative.\nSpeaker 1: I could if you allow me, I could share the screen and I could just show you a few examples.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.", "doc_id": "1f7779fe-6a3a-4151-ba8b-8c62a75784ca", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a0e560b6370ce877f914760dd6efec7bcb0b9c81b50135b4fe9bcfde2a8adb7d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3937, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "29dae81d-fdef-4a2d-81ba-99e4dbcad0a0", "3": "46a9560b-1ea4-41fa-b270-5a6bb21db45e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "46a9560b-1ea4-41fa-b270-5a6bb21db45e": {"__data__": {"text": "the screen and I could just show you a few examples.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So from from presentations, to landing pages, to websites, to the annual reports, I will start with the reports. These are the our flash cut. Just one second, please.\nSpeaker 0: Sure.\nSpeaker 1: But this is mainly for the for the IR field.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: And then reports are starting from from September. So here we are speaking of project implementation so far. Yes. The project requires the questionnaires with the companies\nSpeaker 0: -- Mhmm. --\nSpeaker 1: with listed companies getting and research the data. Receiving the internal files\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm. -- are two diligence, then creating the content to meeting. Usually, if it's a country for example, with with the national identity language. In this case, it's Arabic. And English, it has to be provided in both. So we develop the content we received the data, the financial data, and so on. And we incorporated it.\nSpeaker 0: It's very nice.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. The next one. So this one was for the a chain of petrol stations.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: This one is another listed company. So with the area, it's in the IT and servicing sector. Mhmm. So another reporting incorporates all from macro overview to the business model to the risk, to the strategy, to the ESG part and financial and government statement. So this is what we have done it recently. This is another one. This one is an Arabic. So what we are left now is that we finalize the projects. And we need badly new leads and don't sustain for another round. That's why it's my assistant understanding how long does it take?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Completely understand. And that's great, by the way. So obviously, you need more leads. So what's the goal with the business overall just so we can get an actual number on it?\nSpeaker 1: At least if we get two leads for example, if I don't know five k a month or so as a plan, so we can sustain it.\nSpeaker 0: So just two leads at five k month. That's a goal.\nSpeaker 1: But depending on the on the scope and the goal, and and which market we should tap into it, because currently we have been working more in Saudi Arabia, who would be grateful if we can enter a new markets. For example, US along them and so on.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We can definitely talk about that. So in an ideal world, who would your ideal customer be? Who would you want to work with?\nSpeaker 1: Big firms or to be as an an outsourced company for the advisory firms. As we have been already in contact when we we are experiencing. Cool. So Either it's it's it's an adviser of firms who need assistance with the content creation and creative. Or it's direct to the companies who need assistance with the white materials with the content, with presentations and some rebranding.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's great.\nSpeaker 1: So far in our portfolio, we have more than ten clients, big ones.\nSpeaker 0: You have more than ten clients right now? Yeah. That's perfect. That's perfect. Alright. So ideally, you know, you mentioned big firms. Is there any specific industry that you like to target?\nSpeaker 1: Not not not not quite specifically. It can be any any any companies like chains, I don't know in any companies. As I just mentioned to you previously, so where we have been in contact with acquiring leads, professional. So he had been targeting a low base profile of clients. Catering cleaning companies and services and so on. And at that time, it resulted to zero.\nSpeaker 0: Zero.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Yes. And the campaign was rolling on for, like, one month or so. Wow. Yeah. And the channels were, like, LinkedIn base. Yeah. Yeah. That was the main tapping point.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.

Why do you think it should work?\nSpeaker 1: Sorry?\nSpeaker 0: Why do you think it didn't work?\nSpeaker 1: I don't know, to be honest. Maybe it wasn't the right time or maybe it was the the offer that didn't quite represent a lot. Because first, we start as a SEO company that provides changing optimization. And websites, and it didn't go well. Like, it wasn't a specific offer. About everything and nothing. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're completely right. If it's the broad office never tend to go well. Alright. Cool. And, obviously, what we wanna do and the way we typically do things is we leverage your past results to help you get more of the same client. So if you hope to firm making ten million or a hundred million in this industry, what we'll do is we'll just go after similar companies or even bigger ones and say, hey, we help this company to get these results, would you be open to give them the same? That's pretty much our framework behind doing this. It's very outcome based. It's very specific. So in terms of the results that you get for your clients, are there any sort of numbers or metrics that you track for them? Any sort of, you know, revenue numbers that you help to generate?\nSpeaker 1: That's a very good question. So what we offer, it's a case study of performance during the year. So this is an intangible asset for the listed companies but actually that provides value in time with them attracting attention for the investors. Yeah. So that's the in base. Quite metrics for those companies. How many how many investors that they got in touch with? We cannot compare because we we don't retain such information. Usually, this is this product is required by the CMA regulations and sec regulations like in America. That you need to post the financial performance in the listed listed profile. No. No. It's like NASDAQ and so on. But in America, we observed that there is not much go into detail of the design as per in Europe and the Middle East and to China and so on. This product, it it has a period of time, which starts from September, and it ends in the end of March. Mhmm. Submission.\nSpeaker 0: I see. I see. Alright. So are there any numbers at all that you guys track in terms of the results?\nSpeaker 1: As an outsourced company, we have been in agreement of how much we are gonna receive as a revenue. From the and would would count the scope, the cost, and the time, and as a total. But this is our side not not the not the client side.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Unfortunately, in that situation, I don't think we'll be able to help you out.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Again, I really appreciate your time. That's great speaking to you. But just because of the fact that we won't be able to leverage significant metrics in terms of what you did for the companies in the past. And, you know, assuming that this is our main method for actually attracting the clients, I just don't think our method of doing it will be the most effective for you. So the last thing I want is for you to, you know, wouldn't want you to get bad results like the last agency. You know?\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. Absolutely. Usually, you take clients based on what on on metrics? Like, do they provide you kind of metrics on their revenues?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. There's a I'll tell you the few things that I look for or that the team looks for when we're taking on new clients. The first one is past results. Right? So who have you helped in the past? And what result did you get for the clients? So for example, most of our clients now, they're offering very outcome based services. So for example, SEO, pay per click, conversion rate optimization, TikTok ads, whatever it might be. And it's very clear what the outcome was. So for example, generate an extra two hundred thousand in sales. This is the first thing that we look for, a tangible outcome.

And then I can talk to Mark and Rebecca next week.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. Alright. Fantastic. And I'll just record the call to make sure everything's everything's clear. Alright. So fantastic. So to give a quick overview, all the calls usually go. I typically just wanna starting for us with some quick questions right after I explain a bit about what we do.

Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 0: That's perfect.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool. So to give the shortest overview on what we do, is that we help establish marketing agencies on average add an extra fifty to one hundred thousand dollars per month by building out client acquisition machine. So we usually do this within around six to nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help to solve is client acquisition. Right? Usually, these agencies, they have all the foundations in place already. They have the systems. They have the team. They have amazing client results They're grown from a photos which just indicates that your clients love what you're doing. They have a sales process that's proven to work and they have people to take the calls. The only thing stopping them from scaling up or hitting whatever the revenue goals are is speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day And if they can do that, if they can get in contact with people that can afford their services, can afford high retainers that want what they're offering, they can speak to them every single day, scale becomes pretty much inevitable. Is everything clear there?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That makes complete sense.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. So The first thing that I want to ask because, again, I was looking forward to the call is what made you wanna schedule the call in the first\nSpeaker 0: place? We are looking to grow. With coming off of COVID, things have stagnated a little bit, and then it's, you know, It's time.\nSpeaker 1: A hundred percent. So after COVID things started stagnating, started slowing down?\nSpeaker 0: They slowed down a little bit, not a lot. In COVID, but we're at a point where our team is solid. Mhmm. And we can afford to and want to grow But you get into into that cycle of, you know, you've got leads that you've had for five or six years and they just you know, they haven't gone anywhere. You you get a couple bites here and there, but we we need to find a mechanism to start moving forward.\nSpeaker 1: Like a a more predictable way of getting these clients signed as opposed to just hearing that.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And and getting things that are real targeted where we used to go with a lower level client. We're in a position now to go with much higher level clients and breaking into know, the realm of where a global agency would be offering services isn't as easy for a boutique agency.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent because you guys clearly have a solid foundation. I think you have, like, multiple locations", "doc_id": "0159abe5-7c16-4b3b-a5e9-4da79d361907", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a27fde7424cf6291cc4bd7695c254e3eac1eae97304a4177d3bec3d4c041cc15", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3917, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ebcc8a3-4626-4b88-ab11-0ef85540dff9", "3": "5b37bd9f-d9d1-4df5-82e3-c0c48620d55c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b37bd9f-d9d1-4df5-82e3-c0c48620d55c": {"__data__": {"text": "you guys clearly have a solid foundation. I think you have, like, multiple locations as well. Correct? Mhmm. Fantastic. So just so that we can get an actual metric on it. What's your goal? Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna be?\nSpeaker 0: I would say, probably at three to four million.\nSpeaker 1: Per month appear?\nSpeaker 0: Per year.\nSpeaker 1: Cool.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, per month would be lovely. But but that that also would require a lot of\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Internal structural growth.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. The back end on three million per month would be quite quite complex. Alright. Cool. Perfect. Three to four million per year. How far is that from you guys are right now?\nSpeaker 0: Double?\nSpeaker 1: Double. Cool. So about, you know, one to two million player?\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: Cool. Cool. So it seems correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems simple enough. The goal is to go from one point two million PR to three point three to four. The only thing stopping from getting there is just signing more clients. And if you can do that consistently, then we'll hit the target. K. Alright. Cool. Perfect. So the next thing that I just wanna go into is exactly who you want to work with. Because like you mentioned, you're at you have the capabilities of going after bigger clients, more established ones. You have choice of who you want to work with, who is your ideal client.\nSpeaker 0: We were primarily e commerce and franchise organizations. We work we work with franchise owners, not franchisees.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, we work with them by extension, but our contracts are generally with a franchisor or large e commerce. Somebody like, we do some work with universal, They're they're a great client for us. We do a lot in the b d b space. We worked with Linux. For quite a while. Yes. So those are the types the the larger types of clients we would be looking for, you know, If we could pick off Blue Nile, that would be lovely.\nSpeaker 1: That would be a nice one. Have you ever heard of Ili cafe or five hour energy? No. No. Wow. Alright. Never mind then. I think they are probably like the biggest coffee brand. One of the biggest coffee brands in the world. I think we just booked a meeting with them today for one of our clients in e commerce. But just to get some context, obviously, e commerce is a very broad service b to b, service franchises. Yeah. Is there anything more specific that you're looking for in these specific industries?\nSpeaker 0: No. We work across verticals.\nSpeaker 1: Cool.\nSpeaker 0: We're we're looking for people who can afford a ten at least a ten thousand dollars retainer for Search engine optimization.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Perfect. That's great. So it's not we don't want the small brands, the people just starting out the a guy that just put up his website. We want the established brands seven eight nine figure brands only.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Perfect. That makes a lot more sense. So it's not just in order to get to three to four million EPS, not just a matter of getting you in contact with e commerce brands or B2B businesses. It's the established ones. The ones who have the existing foundation, the ones who have the money that can afford a ten k a month retainer.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. Cool. And right now, what are you currently doing to attract these type of clients?\nSpeaker 0: We we obviously have our website working for for wheat. A lot of our business comes from referrals from our current clients. Mhmm. We do we do some outbound\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Email. Mhmm. I'm sorry. It's a little early for me yet. I need to think very early in the morning.\nSpeaker 1: Coffee healthy health.\nSpeaker 0:", "doc_id": "5b37bd9f-d9d1-4df5-82e3-c0c48620d55c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "894897bc980b6547970b686867150a1fe2a307671fac5e509aa751435c7b517b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3847, "end": 7623, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ebcc8a3-4626-4b88-ab11-0ef85540dff9", "2": "0159abe5-7c16-4b3b-a5e9-4da79d361907", "3": "16ae537e-3146-4d3a-b0e1-49f1073ed713"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "16ae537e-3146-4d3a-b0e1-49f1073ed713": {"__data__": {"text": "in the morning.\nSpeaker 1: Coffee healthy health.\nSpeaker 0: That's exactly what I'm doing.

Yeah. Either way.\nSpeaker 0: Well, I got your work on time.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I see that.\nSpeaker 0: What are we doing? Our CEO is the one who handles most of our biz dev, so we do a lot of a lot of networking. Mhmm. We we do some stuff with LinkedIn. The answer is we don't have a specific protocol other than doing continual outreach.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: We have and doing multiple touch points We have a a newsletter, an ongoing newsletter. We have some pretty decent social putting some things out there. To keep our name out there. We have people who do some writing -- Mhmm. -- for some of the you know, do some thought leadership kind of things. That's kinda where we're at.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, that's good. The thing I always like to hear is that you're growing from a folks because that's just an indicator that you're great at what you're doing. So growing from a photo, some outbound emails, some outbound LinkedIn, networking, mainly done by CEO, people doing some writing and then some new sales, so some inbound work as well. Correct? Mhmm. Cool. And correct me if I'm wrong, but with the referrals you can't really choose exactly who you want to work with. So this is -- Correct.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: along with other clients. Yeah. So obviously, you can get new business in, but you kind of have to take whatever comes to you because you can't really be proactive as to exactly who you want to work with. So we can't you're not specifically getting, you know, e commerce brands, making seven figures per year with a great service, with a great founder.\nSpeaker 0: So Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Alright. Cool. Glad we're on the same page because this is generally something I get every single day with our current clients. And with, you know, calls like these. So cool is it seems simple enough. And the CEO is managing most of the best of himself.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. He's he is particular when we take on clients. We we kind of audition them while they're auditioning us to make sure that they're going to be a good fit. Our team is made of senior level people. You have to have ten years of experience in what you do to be even be considered for a job here.\nSpeaker 1: Yes.\nSpeaker 0: So it's you know, the the people that we have are not inexpensive. Yeah. But they're very, very good at what they do.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And so we're not going to bring in a client that we don't believe we can make successful because SEO is one of those things where it takes time and trust. Mhmm. And there's some really bad SEO firms out there where people that say they know how to do it and they really don't Yeah. So we make sure that we're setting ourselves as well as our clients up for success and it there are clients that have prospects that have come to us that in the end, we decide not to work with them. We're like, look, you know, we we've looked at all your stuff.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And the reality is, you're gonna give us a bunch of money and we're not gonna be able to help you for these reasons.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So Mark likes to say stay very intimately involved in the process. Best so that he's setting both our clients up for success as well as our team because you don't wanna take someone on that's just internally frustrating. To themselves and to us because that doesn't really help with our emotional balance. And and, I mean, Yeah. Only is one thing, but making sure that we're taking on the right things matters.\nSpeaker 1: That's", "doc_id": "16ae537e-3146-4d3a-b0e1-49f1073ed713", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c0f06f06c03787a5ae2f15edeea1e9116f620a712a96b5f14010df7cbad6b324", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7642, "end": 11437, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ebcc8a3-4626-4b88-ab11-0ef85540dff9", "2": "5b37bd9f-d9d1-4df5-82e3-c0c48620d55c", "3": "6ed96402-1238-45b1-a202-47944d4c7b54"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6ed96402-1238-45b1-a202-47944d4c7b54": {"__data__": {"text": "making sure that we're taking on the right things matters.\nSpeaker 1: That's an extremely small point. And that's the same reason we extend our own sales cycle because after the short term money, okay, cool. But if you're working with them on a long term basis, and your team has to work them every day and they're frustrating, you you know, can't get results for whatever reason. It's it's not worth it. In terms of the long term consequences. So rate point. Alright. Cool. So I know you mentioned you guys are you guys are clearly excellent at what you do. Ten plus years' experience just to get like an opportunity there. That's amazing. Do any of them have experience in sort of business outbound lead generation?\nSpeaker 0: No.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. Cool. Just ask because, obviously, you guys are great at what you do. But if you're using that time doing, for example, lead generation, like, sending emails as opposed to SEO, which you guys are experts in is probably not the best the best use of your time. Either way. Cool. And one of the last things I want to ask is when are you actually looking to start signing more clients looking to start scaling up.\nSpeaker 0: Now now is good.\nSpeaker 1: Good answer. Not end of q four or anything like that.\nSpeaker 0: No. No. No. No. There's March is a vacation time, so we've got a little a little bit of stuff with that, but I would say probably April first. We would be ready to --\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: -- we'd have time to get our ducks in a row and -- Yeah. -- and start really focused sitting on it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Because by the time the vacation things done, we can just get everything set up. Yeah. Alright. Cool. Perfect. Then based on that and correct me if I'm wrong, but just to recap, you're currently at around one to two millennia, the goal is to get to three to four millennia. You guys clearly, clearly have all the foundations in place. You have a phenomenal team. I mean, needing ten plus years of experience just to get an opportunity that's insanely good. You have an amazing team. You have the systems. You have happy clients because you're growing off referrals. You have a sales process that's proven to convert. The only thing stopping from going to or from one point two to three point four, three two four, is signing more clients. And we can just get you in contact with more qualified clients, qualified e commerce brands, b to b businesses that can pay you ten thousand dollars per month, and you can speak to them every single all day, I mean, getting there will be pretty straightforward. Is anything I missed that?\nSpeaker 0: Nope. You got a nice straight line there.\nSpeaker 1: I like that. Alright. In that case, you're like ninety nine percent of the agencies we work with. Because they all face very similar issues in terms of looking to scale up. Do you mind if I share what the next step to be?\nSpeaker 0: I think that'd be fabulous.\nSpeaker 1: Me too. So like I was saying, I genuinely think you're a great fit. And to give a quick overview, just like we spoke about at the start of what we do, is we help establish marketing agencies, typically add an extra fifty to a hundred thousand dollars per month within six to nine months by building out the client acquisition machines. And like I was saying, you have all the foundations ready. It's really just a matter of getting in contact with more of these audio prospects every single day. And we can do that consistently and predictably as opposed to sporadic inbound from referrals or, you know, LinkedIn or networking. Then scale will be it'll be comfortable. It'll be straightforward because everything will be based off of the numbers. So would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a custom much proposal on exactly how things can help you reach, you know, three to four million per year.\nSpeaker 0: That would be great. And we could include Mark in that call because he'll be back in the office.\nSpeaker", "doc_id": "6ed96402-1238-45b1-a202-47944d4c7b54", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "85597ed722b521590526f81b24b2f98e871f66276968bcdf954872916448adf6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11426, "end": 15412, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ebcc8a3-4626-4b88-ab11-0ef85540dff9", "2": "16ae537e-3146-4d3a-b0e1-49f1073ed713", "3": "aaa1e9fa-e42a-4ed8-beac-a7cc7c46ddfa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "aaa1e9fa-e42a-4ed8-beac-a7cc7c46ddfa": {"__data__": {"text": "And we could include Mark in that call because he'll be back in the office.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing.

We can push it back a bit later. Hopefully. Let me just\nSpeaker 0: Where are you?\nSpeaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now.\nSpeaker 0: I have not. No. That is one of those places I would like to go, but I haven't. I have some friends that were missionaries there for years. Mhmm. I absolutely loved it.\nSpeaker 1: Beautiful place.\nSpeaker 0: And I understand that to be the case.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. So I'm just gonna send over a scheduling link. And then if any of these prompts work for you, just let me\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Wednesday or Wednesday, probably.\nSpeaker 1: Tuesday or Wednesday?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I'm looking at his calendar. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Tuesday's way better than Wednesday. I had to look at my calendar too.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Do any of these times work for you?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Let's call it at ten, my ten.\nSpeaker 1: I was curious about the role of chief happiness coordinator. Never heard that one before.\nSpeaker 0: My job is a lot of things like everyone else here, I had to have more than ten years experience to get this job. Yeah. A second loop at work on here. The happiness part of my job is twofold. One is quality assurance with our clients. I speak with them on a regular basis to make sure that we are meeting their expectations. If there's any tweaks we can make, we try and do that. It's also an opportunity to try and sell organic growth. Within our clients to kinda see what's coming.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So if there's something that we can do that'll help us grow with our current clients that being a little bit easier because you already know what you're getting into. I also make sure that, you know, they get pizza and lunch on their birthday and stuff like that. Internally, I work with our chief of operations to make sure that everything is running smoothly within the team and do things with them to make sure that our team is also happy that they're getting what they need, that if there's, you know, sometimes we're pretty small organization. So, yeah, there's not a lot of water cooler talk and we're virtual, so we don't sit in the same room. Mhmm. But there's times you don't wanna go to the boss with something, but you need somebody to ask a question or whatever. So I kind of fill that role. I also help Mark with biz dev. I've got thirty years in marketing. So this is kind of my summer retirement job.\nSpeaker 1: You must be vulnerable people.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's It's one of my superpowers.\nSpeaker 1: Can imagine. Team of love.\nSpeaker 0: So that's, you know, I'm kind of the utility player. I can I can do a lot of things? I worked for large agencies, so I know how to put proposals together to resonate with CMOs. I know there's there's a lot of things that I do here. So\nSpeaker 1: That's interesting. My focus is also a lot on people, so I'm always looking to learn. That sounds amazing. Alright. Julie was great speaking as always. And\nSpeaker 0: -- Okay. -- the one thing that I do that I do need to be able to answer for Mark before he'll get on a call with you, is how does this work from a financial standpoint?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's a great question. So the way we structure the pricing is we work on a retainer plus percentage of revenue generated. Alright? So to give some more context onto this, it's usually a flat retainer. And plus, for example, if you if we help you sign a twenty thousand dollar per month retainer yourself, we will take, for example,", "doc_id": "aaa1e9fa-e42a-4ed8-beac-a7cc7c46ddfa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bae668ce1084913f444b04e9244d1e3ae8456b11576d88074742ae8486df36b7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15409, "end": 19181, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5ebcc8a3-4626-4b88-ab11-0ef85540dff9", "2": "6ed96402-1238-45b1-a202-47944d4c7b54", "3": "93be12be-77a1-4b4d-9903-824eb2549bbc"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "93be12be-77a1-4b4d-9903-824eb2549bbc": {"__data__": {"text": "a twenty thousand dollar per month retainer yourself, we will take, for example, nine percent of the first month. And that's really there just to incentivize us doing the best possible job for you and making sure that your team closes the deal because we see a lot of agencies they They work on a flat retainer, and they have no real incentive to get you guys increasingly good results. So we like to make sure we both want the same thing. And that's why we do it that way.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So the percentage would only apply to the first month that wouldn't apply to a full year contract.\nSpeaker 1: Correct.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And what does your average retainer look like?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So on average, the retainers can vary from three thousand one hundred to seven thousand dollars per month. And again, this really varies depending on the complexity of the project. Mhmm. But if it's if you run a single service to one ICP, it's it's not there's not much complexity there. But for others, you know, they wanna add an extra five hundred thousand per month and extra potentially even million per month. So there's a lot more things running, and that's where the price really increases. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We'd love to do that, but that would also require every month increasing our infrastructure and that just --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- that setting up that setting us up for failure. You need to make sure that you can scale both at the same time.\nSpeaker 1: That's a great point. And to a degree, it does. But on the other end, is that Imagine you had complete choice of who you want to work with. So if you only worked with luxury fashion brands in e commerce, Imagine how much more simplified your delivery would be as opposed to working with b to b e commerce, the pizza shop down the road, So by actually choosing one ICP and sticking to that, it's actually gonna add a lot of simplicity to your actual delivery. Well, Lisa's what we found based on our post lines.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that well, it makes sense if you have people trying to work at a particular vertical --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- then then it's, you know, wash rins repeat.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. That's the same reason we only work with established marketing agencies because we can really streamline the delivery.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Alright. Great. Well, if you would be so kind as to send me the recording of this call so he can review it in advance. Sure. I will talk to him when he gets back, and we'll see if this is something he has an appetite for.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So to give some quick context between now and the actual call, obviously, I'll send through the recording. I'll confirm everything through email, through LinkedIn. And between now and then, either myself or someone else in the team will reach out to you and whoever else is coming on the call just to make sure everything went well, just to confirm the next one, And then in the actual proposal call, assuming everything's good, we'll go through a ton of case studies of agencies exactly like yours. Our exact process, so you could do this with or without us. And then the additional details like pricing, outworks, implementation, things like that. Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 0: That's perfect. Thank you, Ethan.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool. Julie, Chris speaking, and I'll talk to you on the twenty first of March.\nSpeaker 0: Great.

Hundred percent. I agree completely. And a mistake say, it's the time, really, the the time gap between not knowing and knowing. That's what I really wanna see.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. That that's that's the, you know, that that's the thing that and and I'm I'm certainly I'm up for learning as much as you can about something. But, you know, sometimes, you know, you do need outside help and other times, you know, things just take the time to to to learn and experiment. And and I can imagine your job is is certainly where you need to try things and, you know, or that they plateau and you need to, you know, change things up.\nSpeaker 1: You can't keep doing the same thing. Hundred percent. Hundred percent. But yeah. Yeah. It's gonna\nSpeaker 0: be No. I'm I'm it's really cool. And you know, just to give you a bit of bit of feedback. Yeah. I really enjoyed the way you conducted that meeting last week as well. Just in the way that you structured it and, you know, and and I I obviously from my business. So, you know, I'm the the person that's speaking to clients, selling the business, selling the the the kind of value and so forth. And, you know, I just thought the way that you you put that together in a in a way that kind of, you know, shaped the the meeting was was really good.\nSpeaker 1: I appreciate it. I always I always like the feedback. And I -- Mhmm. -- I really appreciate it too because, I mean, learning is the ultimate goal, to be honest. So anything that can help you about moving in. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No worries at all. Let's dive into this because I've the reason I I moved this was I've just gotta get away at about ten to seven, quarter to seven. So, yeah, let let us know how how you go\nSpeaker 1: hundred percent and before the Internet cuts out. So I thought the best way to start with this call is just to recap what we spoke about on the last one just to make sure on the same page that everything's clear. And then assuming everything\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Yes. -- I'll go into the actual proposal. So I'll stop by going through ton of case studies, our exact process, and then all the other details and then answer any questions that you might have. Is that okay with you? It sounds good. Yeah. Perfect. Alright. Cool. So like in the last call, we discussed that The goal really at this point is to sign two clients per month. Right? It can go higher, get a little, but that is the main goal. And the only thing stopping you from signing these two clients per month, three, four clients, whatever it might be, is speaking to more qualified prospects every single day. That need what you're offering and that can afford what you're offering. And like on the last one, you clearly have all the foundations ready. You have capacity and you're ready to sign more clients. You have case studies, you work with some of the best brands in Australia. You have a great team, You guys can convert, you can sell. Your clients love you like you have everything that needs to be there, beverage. All we need to do is just get you in contact with more brands that can afford what you're offering that need what you're offering. And if you can just speak to them every single day, you know, I'm I'm very certain that you'll be able to at least sell a few of them every single month. Yes. I'm reasonably close to your situation.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's exactly. And and just just one thing though that that might, you know, might be a little bit different from the the software company that you're working with. Mhmm. Just in the fact that that kind of the the work that we do, a lot of people want, you know, they they want Australian companies to work with Australian companies. They want, you know, I'd I'd find it quite a quite hard at at our present scale even though the teams in Europe for a UK company, for example, to to to work with us. That's not to say that they", "doc_id": "e4339cad-25cf-46de-a89f-cec9db538a5c", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d127201d858f9eed5a51caee8082bc755941d874ba25628fe9f8360b6e76c50c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3482, "end": 7457, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "22b9fcb4-0127-431e-b688-9f4fc4241a58", "3": "20769fe0-e394-4448-8816-0a839a53c213"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "20769fe0-e394-4448-8816-0a839a53c213": {"__data__": {"text": "UK company, for example, to to to work with us. That's not to say that they wouldn't. And, you know, I have worked with UK companies in the past, but there's been through recommendations and and my network rather than, you know, coming to us against, you know, three different companies say because most of our our clients would would, you know, get three to four quotes or or look at three three companies. And and I'm hoping that, you know, the way although this is cold outreach, you know, that that you know, people feel that, you know, they they may not need to do that in this process, but but certainly the bigger clients that we're looking at, we would be looking to get three quotes. And and if there's two companies that are similar to us and they're based in the UK and they're a UK client, they're gonna go with them. So I that's just a a kind of heads up to you and a a war not not a warning, but a kind of, you know, in in that I think we do need to focus on Australian clients and as our bread and butter.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's perfectly fine. Why do you or quickly, why do you think it is that they prefer to go with a UK or European company, for example? I\nSpeaker 0: think because of the because of the size of the the kind of contract, the fact that you'd be working together for a long time, it it's not a it's not a commodity yet, although some people would might say it is. But it's it's certainly the, you know, they they wanna if anything goes wrong and they they they want you to come meet them face to face or they want you to be at least on the same time zone and and being able to get on a flight for an hour if you're based in Germany say or wherever. You know? So it's yeah. Those are the reasons. And I think Australia is such, you know, cut off, you know, sometimes it doesn't feel like it, you know, it's a very modern country, but but certainly, you know, just in in time zones and geographically it's cut off from Europe.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, that's perfectly fine. That's perfectly fine. You know, honestly, it could even be a a competitive advantage because, you know, not many people actually reach out to Australia in the first place. Australian brands. So ninety percent of our clients are from Europe, U. S. Canada, for example, and they prefer -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: example targeting UK, US, Canada as opposed to Australia, New Zealand, things like that. So The way I see there'll be a lot less competition for Sunlight is able to reach out to these Australian brands. If your goals would just go for them initially, And then easily, we could just expand to international beyond that.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, that that that would be great. And as I said to you, I'm not opposed to having a, you know, a so called UK office and and certainly a UK somebody there answering the phone as as a employee of Fuze mobile. And yeah. So, you know, that that can certainly happen. The states I always find is a, you know, a hard nut crack because of, again, the size of it and maybe the competitive nature. But certainly, you know, there's this I'm open. I'm open to to expanding the business. And and certainly, my my CTO who who's pretty much a partner in in the business based in Poland with the development team. We are, you know, he's ready to, you know, he's ready to go for it.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. And the last point I wanna mention before we go to the actual proposal is we've had situations like this before, not necessarily in software development. But in other or with other marketing agencies. And what they found is that to the prospect, their business and all the others looks like commodity like you were saying, they look exactly the same. And because of that, prospects would, you know, get five, ten quotes of other agencies, see what they're charging, and they just pick the lowest one. And that's obviously not the lowest we go about it. But What we found is that if we're able to position you or", "doc_id": "20769fe0-e394-4448-8816-0a839a53c213", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c24949cc08421a212d5be4a5c50bbef1093337f4934319945c37fa0b0d77fc45", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7456, "end": 11428, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "e4339cad-25cf-46de-a89f-cec9db538a5c", "3": "b1a5be95-4fa3-41c7-a64d-454463106dad"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b1a5be95-4fa3-41c7-a64d-454463106dad": {"__data__": {"text": "we go about it. But What we found is that if we're able to position you or differentiate what you're doing as opposed to everyone else, email that's unique that can stand out, that looks different from everyone else, then you're not seen as a commodity anymore, and you're, you know, selling in a pool of one. Right? You're the unique -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- that that's so important. That that is and and that's something I'm working on in in everything in in the way that I talk to people, the way that we engage, the way that we put proposals together, the way that we talk about what we do, you know, that it isn't about software development, it's about the value. And I had that with a client this week, you know, it it was, you know, he was trying to talk to me, you know, that, you know, things that kind of, you know, you know, blown out a little bit in the scope. And and, you know, it's pretty much down to him changing the scope. But I was like, look, just think about the value. You're you're gonna be selling this business, you know, in a year, two years time for millions. And he and he really is that's not being being unrealistic. And I'm like, you know, you're quibbling over, like, you know, ten, twenty, thirty k. It's like it really isn't it's not a big difference. You know, it's it's not gonna make a big big difference to you in a in a year, two years time. So so that's the kind of conversations I have with people and and trying to position ourselves as as Yeah. It's something of of value and and that value is is, you know, certainly,\nSpeaker 1: you're gonna see that in your ROI. Hundred percent. Because ultimately, you know, it's an uphill battle if we're just trying to compete with other agencies in there. Know, just given quotes. But if we can be seen as a completely unique solution, then there's really no competition at the end of the day.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And just to your point there and I won't expand on it too much. But I've personally been thinking about, look, how do we kind of change that? You know, even even, you know, we've been known as Fuze Mobile for twelve years and and Mobile was, you know, was that big platform shift that happened twelve, thirteen, fourteen years ago. And I've just been thinking, look, do we do we have a little bit of a name change there and and, you know, keep the fuse element. But but really, you know, it's an innovation studio. It's say, you know, it's a product studio rather than being a a software developer. So that that's my thinking in in how we position ourselves. Hundred percent.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool. And that's some this is something we go into a ton of detail for all of our clients. The first step in our process, and I'm gonna go through it right now, is actually offer creation. So how can we position your business in a way that stands out allows you to potentially charge more, book more meetings, increase a close percentage, everything that comes with being a unique solution. So I'll just share my screen quickly. We can actually go through this. Yeah. Sure. Alright. Cool. Can you see this clearly?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Can. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. So all welcome how to add an extra fifty to a hundred k a month to your agency within six nine months by integrating our client acquisition machine. So in this quick call, what I wanna do is, firstly, share how to customize your client acquisition and agency growth, the three step system to add an extra fifty hundred k a month without ad spend, problems that may be preventing you from predictably signing clients and booking sales calls. Our exact system outline so you could genuinely do this with or without us. Unique lead generation and client acquisition knowledge found through thousands and thousands of split tests that you can't find online, except on my YouTube channel, How marketing agencies exactly like yours?

Just so you can get an idea of what we do, how it works, things to that degree. So first one, my good friend, Charlie Morgan. If you're on YouTube, you might know who he is. You're able to scale to two point eight million per year, two hundred thirty five k a month using only outreach. Right? And The reason I'll bring them up is because we did a lot of work together, but because we'd be using the exact same systems for you, And it just shows what's possible without paid advertising, paid acquisition, things to that degree, and how effective it can be. Another one working with Ricky share. All things\nSpeaker 0: Sorry, Ethan. Can I just ask you a quick question there? With with Charlie, just sorry. Can you just go back to\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: That so you scaled that within what time time frame?\nSpeaker 1: So this was in about, say, a year and two months. That's incredible. Charlie is an absolute\nSpeaker 0: And and sorry. What what does Charlie do? Just just to be clear.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. So, Charlie, what is he ran with the agency the past, and then he converted to selling a, what do I say, a program or mentorship on how to do that, on how to scale your agents. So -- Yeah. Sure.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: because that his back end operations are extremely efficient, which is why it's able to increase revenue by this amount in this sort of time frame.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. So just getting clear on what you guys worked on. So you you worked on the agency and then the the kind of changeover to his his kind of content or course, whatever he was doing.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So we came in straight when he was doing the new course.\nSpeaker 0: Right? We didn't -- Okay. Gotcha. --\nSpeaker 1: initially, it was just for the course.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. Amazing. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Cool. So another on ricochet Holdings. Kenny Stevens, he has from five hundred thousand followers. There is a Russell Branson. He runs an eight figure holding company slash growth agency. He is also in terms of his project size, also very similar to yours, except with e commerce brands specifically. So he's charging, you know, fifty hundred k hundred and fifty k potentially even in the first three months for the type of deals that he works with. So that's what's pretty similar to yours. Gaurav Fred, he's building eight figure affiliate marketing systems from e commerce brands, Zach, he is the founder of FlexLabs that we're talking about in the last form. Is size -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: business. The first is straight, you know, paid acquisition, email marketing as well, CRO, or combined into one service. But then also the delay. So it's charging -- Yep.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: two hundred three hundred k per project, building out apps for e commerce brands, Yep. That much for the degree. He's also also a legend. Right? We've got Chris running a seven figure e commerce growth agency, John Bullied seven figure on systems for agencies. I'll go through these quickly because I want you to be on this call all day. Scott Austin, seven hundred and forty k in the pipeline generated for his new company, and What I really wanna emphasize here is before and after. Because, obviously, these are cool. You know, that's great. But What you're gonna notice is there is a reoccurring theme across all of our clients and is that they're great at what they do. Right? They've grown from a forest which indicates the clients love them. They're able to sell. They're able to deliver. They just don't have a predictable way of getting in contact with these ideal prospects every single day. That's it.\nSpeaker 0: So they're trying to Let's even go back to so the guy that was with Richard Bronson that's got the sorry.

Russell Bronson that's got the Yeah. Yeah. So Kenny Stevens. So he had a growth agency as and and that's as in kind of, you know, working with other companies growing there kind of online. Yeah. Yeah. Is this I assume?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So what he still has the growth agency. He just has multi multiple areas of the company. So Ricochet Holdings is actually a holding company. And he has the growth agency in there, which is growing e commerce reps using paid acquisition. Then he has -- Yep.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: obviously, an acquisition portion of it. So he's actually investing in e commerce businesses. And then he has ones where he partners with them. So he has, you know, yeah, just much bigger involvement into it. It becomes upon the portion of the business, and that's where the big projects really come from.\nSpeaker 0: And how long you've been working with him him with info?\nSpeaker 1: I've only been working with Kenny for around six months at this point. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Cool. That's no. So it's it's it's some great great people you've got there.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And and kind of, you know, really interesting. It seems that they they kind of quite you know, they they're developing their personal brand and you know, it and that's working and and I'm certainly not opposed to that. Have you found that that's worked for them, you know, Or do you find that that's the kind of way forward in in the way that they're they're building other areas of their business? Or or do you think that you that's not necessary to to to grow the, you know, the development agency say?\nSpeaker 1: That is a great question. And It's not necessary, and the foundation of a a good business as you definitely understand is, obviously, firstly, a great service, a great delivery. But I will say in acquisition, having a brand is like a force multiplier on everything. Yeah. That's true. The same reason why I post content, it's the same reason why I saw you on LinkedIn posting. You had a great post today? Yep. And the same reason I've both had YouTube. Yep. Because\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Now I've I've I'm really stepping it up in in that respect. Only focusing on on LinkedIn at the moment and and we'll move over to Twitter. But -- Yeah. -- yeah. I I think I said, you know, there's there's a newsletter that that I'll be doing on -- Yeah. -- how to start an AI company, you know, software company. And that that'll be just interviewing founders, you know, rather just being a, like, all the others out, the million others out there that are just taking a a kind of, you know, aggregating what what news is out there. I I really wanna talk to all these kind of founders of the build building AI tools and and just really dive a little bit deeper into into that. So, yeah, there's there's certainly areas that I'm looking to to kind of not branch off to. They're all connected a bit like, you know, these entrepreneurs that you're you're dealing with. Yeah. But obviously, I need the the engine of the the agency to drive, you know, the the kind of repeatable sales and the cash flow to be able to do the things that I wanna\nSpeaker 1: do. That's a great point. And what we've found and I'm gonna go into more detail on how we do this in the actual process in a minute. But obviously you have the great service. And any sort of content that you do, like I said, it's a force multiplier on the actual outbound that we do. So if it's also to your point of the differentiation, It's also how he differentiates us out because if one person's providing tons of value upfront in terms of LinkedIn post, Twitter posts, YouTube posts, and giving it out all for free, And then they messaged you. Compared to everyone else who has no social presence at all, they're gonna go for the ones who's provided the value. Yeah. Exactly. Because one, they truss actually done it, and they just wanna reciprocate everything that, you know, that's given in the first time.\nSpeaker", "doc_id": "cdba21cf-0508-42a6-8d9d-5d0e392e4987", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "164efd9be61d140b8af46b279e0dfdfa9fe4646cd5c01da87b44b6aea5d842e3", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19381, "end": 23425, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "c8d6d5f5-c508-49c4-bac4-90a3e588dc80", "3": "717a9154-9af9-4c5e-8466-6a11b9a5364e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "717a9154-9af9-4c5e-8466-6a11b9a5364e": {"__data__": {"text": "everything that, you know, that's given in the first time.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Well, they they they feel they feel that kind of you you know, they feel that trust and they also feel that they get to to know you or your style or your, you know, what you stand for really, which is vital in in kind of a relationship business.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. So if If one of the reasons why they choose a UK company over your company is trust, then we can get that trust before even speaking to them, leveraging Gong.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. Absolutely. Absolutely. Certainly can. Yeah. Yeah. And and I just think that side will take time. I mean, that I just wanted to kind of, you know, say that, yeah, that that side that that side will take a little bit of time in in, you know, businesses outside of Australia, but but certainly, yeah, that that's where I see it heading, Ethan. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: And we'll show you exactly how we do it and how the other clients do it as well. So you can actually get a ton of the outcomes with very minimal inputs because obviously, you're busy, you have other things to do and you don't wanna be, you know, making YouTube videos all day.\nSpeaker 0: So No. But but I'm I'm certainly not not opposed to to really up in my my content claim.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. And then, yeah, just to recap on Austin, And again, we're seeing the same things over and over. They tried lead gen agencies. They tried, you know, buying leads, working with services that provide leads to them every month. They just don't see the results that they need. And then after work with us, you know, able to add next twenty four k in revenue, it should be a lot more at this point. It's just not updated. And he's focused solely on service delivery, managing his team and seeing predictable growth. Another one, Daniel, two hundred and twenty eight k in sales Right? This guy is amazing in under thirty days while training a sales team. And again, I'll go through them quick because you see the same thing over and over and over. Growing purely on referrals great service, no predictable sales process. So able to solve but nobody to solve to. They just lack in a system to speak to the qualified prospects gonna fold what they're offering every single day. And once we solve this one problem, this one problem, two hundred twenty eight k in under thirty days. Jeff, same thing. Resync, same thing. Waco, very similar. And then some of the biggest names in the space, Kinkadeau, e com growers on track, above fire. All seven figure marketing agencies. Right? So who is this actually for? Because we at this point, we turned down, we'll agencies that we take on. It's for established b to b marketing agencies with existing results and happy clients. Right? For agencies who don't have a systematic, predictable method of booking meetings and signing clients who rely on referrals for their growth. And again, founders and CEOs who have tried outreach by themselves, by hiring someone else, by working with the lead gen company, but still aren't getting the results that they need. So as for agencies who have a great service, the systems take on clients and the ability to sell, but no way of booking the calls with the qualified prospects in the first place. And then filed since she has got willing and able to add an extra fifty hundred k a month while transitioning from working in the business to working on the business. So what is actually stopping your growth? Right? You can simply add an extra fifty, hundred k by getting more projects, signing more clients, but what stops most agencies? Right? Why don't people just do that? They're just not speaking to enough qualified prospects on a daily based That is it. But the problem is that you as the founder, you as a CEO, you won't have enough time to do this yourself because You have a team to manage. You have clients to manage. You have all these other things. So the only other options that you have is hiring an employee that knows high level sales and marketing. And if they're no", "doc_id": "717a9154-9af9-4c5e-8466-6a11b9a5364e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6278b19c5eb347b6c7150906e6aa6b1d8027e0dbf509e38a9dc7b0b1674a6774", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 23440, "end": 27496, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "cdba21cf-0508-42a6-8d9d-5d0e392e4987", "3": "df29313e-750c-41eb-b529-e3f98a247c03"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "df29313e-750c-41eb-b529-e3f98a247c03": {"__data__": {"text": "an employee that knows high level sales and marketing. And if they're no high level sales and marketing, they most likely have their own businesses or they cost millions beyond salaries. Then option two, you can hire a lead gen agency or freelancer or, you know, one of these lead gen services that don't really have your best interests at heart because they just wanna send you some bookings, get paid, and hope for the best, and most likely won't even deliver So this is why growth partnering is really the only viable option for marketing agencies to really scale up. Because growth partner combines the high level sales and marketing, because we do this for ourselves and for our clients as well, plus aligned incentives. We don't just wanna send you some bookings and hope for the best. We want you to generate revenue. We want you to sign clients. We want you to sign quality clients that you actually wanna work with. And retain. Plus, without costing millions billions salaries, we actually guarantee results. So what I quickly wanna walk you through are the three steps that I recommend to actually increasing revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within around sixty nine months And step one is called prepare the vessel, set the foundations for hybrid growth. Step two is launching the machine, the client acquisition system, and step three is the ultimate of conversion turning interest into revenue. So like we spoke up before in terms of the offer, Right? What I have on the left is the old way of doing things and the old outcome, what most agencies do in GET. And the new way of doing things what we recommend and the new outcome, what our but our clients are getting what we do and how it works. So the old way of doing things is collecting case studies through text. So what means is messaging your client on asking what results they got and putting it on a website. And the thing is you put in all this work to deliver insanely good results, and I know you guys deliver such great results just for prospects to not be able to relate to it or for prospects to think it's fake. Because anyone can just put numbers on a website. Anyone can just fake something. So what you get is you're putting in all this work just for the case studies to not have the potency that you needed to have. So what we recommend for you, for our clients as well, is case study video interviews. And what this is is either you or someone on our team gets onto calls with your past clients, figure out whether work before working with you, whether or after work you and what you did to bridge that gap. So what you get is a highly, highly engaging and incredibly relatable sales asset. That we can leverage before a call, after a call on your LinkedIn, on your website, or anywhere that's gonna pre sell prospects on autopilot so that when they actually do get onto a call, they already know you. They like you and they trust you. Just like we were speaking about earlier, this is how we can leverage media to do ramp it yourself from all the other agencies up in the same thing. And I can't explain how useful, how valuable these case video are. Second thing here, using a commodity offer. So what this is is, obviously, you know all the other development agencies And to the prospect, unfortunately, you may look like everyone else. Even though you like delivering such an amazing service, to the prospect, you just look like everyone else. So you get no interest when you are doing some sort of outreach. You get no interest. You get treated as a commodity. You get, you know, compared with other quotes. And it's just difficult, it's an uphill battle. So what we like to do is start by creating an irresistible offer around what you're already doing. Which will allow you to be seen as extremely unique, allow you to stand out, allow you to book more meetings, allow you to increase your close percentage, and most importantly not be seen as a commodity. Compared to everyone else. And then, thirdly, no profile social proof. So the same with the offer. If you look like everyone else, you're just gonna get what everyone else gets. So, you know, if you're doing outreach on LinkedIn, if you're doing it through email and you have no brand presence,", "doc_id": "df29313e-750c-41eb-b529-e3f98a247c03", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3679aa2a8b904012decd91ff42adf6fc84f47eda1dc35173522c321aec80178f", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 27494, "end": 31742, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "717a9154-9af9-4c5e-8466-6a11b9a5364e", "3": "ce56729a-c2d2-4913-9bd5-90c3bdbe1c32"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ce56729a-c2d2-4913-9bd5-90c3bdbe1c32": {"__data__": {"text": "outreach on LinkedIn, if you're doing it through email and you have no brand presence, again, you're just gonna get them interest. So you you already started with this. You're doing a phenomenal job on LinkedIn, you know, creating that brand, creating that presence, building that trust at scale, So this is something we just help to amplify. We just get you to, you know, make it more efficient, make it more effective, which will allow you to generate more inbound leads generate higher interest, bold trust, at scale, and pre sell prospects before the call so that everyone that does get on to a call is as warm as humanly possible at the time. So step two is launching the machine. And the old way of doing things is very simple. It's for relying on referrals and inbound for growth. And we all know how this is. It's it's unpredictable. It's sporadic, it gives owners anxiety to win or get new cash flow because the business is stagnate or shrink. And you have to work with subpar clients just, you know, get cash flow in the door. You just have to take wherever it comes to you. They may not even be in your in your niche, they might not even fetch your ICP. They might not even be your ideal client. But, you know, sometimes you just have to take them on. So The new way and what we recommend for you and for our clients as well is multi account and multi domain LinkedIn and email outreach. With a dedicated sales team that we hire, manage, train, all of that to convert replies into bookings. And to just go into a bit more detail on that, the reason that we do multi account and multi domain, is it because is because it's incredibly scalable? So if we find that you're signing a two it's a month and you say Ethan. Okay. Let's ramp things up. The team's ready. Let's go to four. Let's go to six. Let's go to ten. It's really just a matter of duplicating what's already working. Right? We don't have to read Can\nSpeaker 0: I just understand sorry, Ethan? Just just with a multi account LinkedIn outreach Could could you just clarify what that means?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So it purely means outreach on multiple LinkedIn accounts.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So so that we outreach from, you know, as if it's coming from our company or from how would that work?\nSpeaker 1: Correct. It'll be completely structured as it's coming from your company. So, yeah, very simply, it would just be, for example, key members of your company sending outreach and booking the appointments.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. Alright. Cool. So the same with email. Just to clarify, they're the same email will all be from, you know, a representative of your company. Everything's in house. Yeah. Unless, for some reason, you wanted to be an external company that can be done too. But what we found best results, your company, And again, multi accounts and multi domain because, you know, if we want to scale up, if you wanna book, you know, sign four clients a month, ten clients a month, It's just a matter of getting either more accounts or more domains and hitting the exact same KPIs with these accounts and scaling up. Again, like I said, we hire, we train, and we manage a day. Don't\nSpeaker 0: you feel I mean, from your experience and and the results, you're seeing that it is predictable. Is that for for, you know, other clients' views\nSpeaker 1: in terms of Are we\nSpeaker 0: able to scale up in terms of scaling up to, you know, if I said to you after the third month that we're we're hitting one to two, that's great. Wanna hit three to four, you know, leads. Is is that Is that achievable?\nSpeaker 1: That's a great question. And not to get ahead of myself, but obviously, I'll initial packages, and I'll talk about the pricing at the end. But the initial packages are what they are. But then for many clients who stay on for after certain few months, they do wanna scale up, and then that is our secondary package and tertiary package where they we offer", "doc_id": "ce56729a-c2d2-4913-9bd5-90c3bdbe1c32", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "00f28318fbe8d9d69e62896e2255563a6e9edc22b305485def2fbfff65fff29e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 31731, "end": 35683, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "df29313e-750c-41eb-b529-e3f98a247c03", "3": "946e8e21-8522-444b-820a-3c6b34ad2289"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "946e8e21-8522-444b-820a-3c6b34ad2289": {"__data__": {"text": "scale up, and then that is our secondary package and tertiary package where they we offer scaling options, if you know what I mean. So we can just double, triple, quadruple the volume if that's the goal. But at that point, I've already made a significant ROI and they're like, yeah. Let's just ramp things up. Sure. Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Good to hear.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. And it it really is that simple. I know a lot of, you know, potential agencies, legion, people they they over complicate things, but it really just If the exact system is just duplicated, we should expect to see the exact same outcomes. So if you're booking twenty meetings a month using this system, and we just duplicate it to another. If we're not seeing forty meetings a month collectively, then something something's wrong. Right? Mhmm. We're very we're very numbers focused, especially my partner. But anyway, he's it's like a robot. But yeah. I like it also. We hire, train, and manage a fully dedicated sales team that does all these bookings replies for you. So that genuinely all we need to do is hop on to calls with interested prospects that know you like you and trust you, that wanna buy what you're offering and sell them on it. And again, systematic predictable growth. Most importantly, you choose exactly who you want to work with. Right? You set the qualification tier if you want to work with only established brands that have the money for making six, seven figures, that's our target. And again, it's incredibly scalable.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: And finally, step three is the old way is having no brand presence. Right? Just having a website and a buy button. But That causes a lack of trust. You have difficulty selling. You get treated as commodity. You get quoted against ten other agencies. So the new way like we're talking about throughout the call is leveraging media and content to bold trust and sell on autopilot without you having to speak to prospects directly. So we can leverage these video case studies, these assets, these sales assets, and we can also leverage your content. Because if prospects are seeing that you're posting content, your active view are providing value for free upfront, they're gonna be much more inclined to want to get on to a call. But also to buy from you. Right? Second, the old way is speaking to unqualified prospects. So you waste hours told me that people aren't even interested in getting onto a call or even having the conversation. So what we wanna do? Because your time is valuable. Because if you're a business owner, you have other things to do, is we wanna presell prospects before calls to pre warm them to increase a close percentage. So we really don't want you to explain in what you do on a call. Like, this should be this should be known before they even get onto the call. Right? That is really our goal. And thirdly, it's just having no sales process. So if you feel like you're constantly guessing what to say, you just hop on the call and ask some questions and, you know, hope for the best. This is what most agencies do, to be honest, it does not. Right? So what we want is a fully optimized sales process, and what we also do is if this could be beneficial for you, what we do is because we're working with generally eight figure agencies, what we do is we just provide the systems used by them in terms of their sales process. And just duplicate it for all of our other clients that don't have a sales process in place. So what you get is a fully optimized sales process from day one That's proven to work. That's proven to generate seven, eight figures. And what we also do is we consistently iterate on it to make sure you're getting as much feedback as possible and improving it while also having weekly evaluations. So either myself or someone on the team will hop on with you or your sales team to make sure they are closing as many deals as possible. By listening to their calls, giving feedback and everything to that degree. And what you get is finally, systematically converting interested prospects", "doc_id": "946e8e21-8522-444b-820a-3c6b34ad2289", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a2e35211c30a22011ca23693d2fe5b5d4ccb1d97e0a78c2806e515142a0278c6", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 35682, "end": 39753, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "ce56729a-c2d2-4913-9bd5-90c3bdbe1c32", "3": "0bafeb85-2a41-4e2e-b153-040253d80d3f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0bafeb85-2a41-4e2e-b153-040253d80d3f": {"__data__": {"text": "to that degree. And what you get is finally, systematically converting interested prospects into high paying funds. So in summary, you can use our three step system to increase your revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within six to nine months. And nearing the end of this, you know, presentation is that you really have three options at this point. You can, I mean, continue what you're doing now? I'm not really having the predictable way to sign clients. Option two is working with a lead gen agency or a lead gen service software. I mean, that doesn't really care what happens with the outcomes and who most likely won't even deliver great qualified leads or anything to that degree. And option three, you could partner with us because we've done this so many times before, have the high level skills from five hundred k plus employee and generally have your best interest at heart. So remember Daniel also Lawrence King and Chris, all the other case studies and the ones that didn't even mention, they started their agencies to help people and make money. And they worked so hard to deliver an amazing service, make their clients happy, and put systems in place. But now, they had the service, but nobody to sell the service too. So booking meetings, the signing clients became the bottleneck. So they tried outreach themselves by work with Allegion service, but they still couldn't achieve the growth that they wanted. And the problem was that they didn't have a client acquisition system. Right? They had leads, but they didn't have the entire system starting with the offer, with the process. With the sales, you know, conversions. So we helped them to build out a brand new offer, build foundation marketing access, launch their campaigns, book meetings, pre sell, optimize the process and continually improve to be able to add an extra twenty, fifteen hundred thousand a month to the revenue. So now, They're removed from client acquisition. They have the time to do anything they want can focus on being a business owner and managing their teams, while the business generally signs clients on autopilot. So one of the last things is that some of the outcomes are working with us is that you'll be able to predictably book meetings to sign clients using proven scalable systems You can add an additional fifty to a hundred k a month to your agency within six to nine months. You can finally stop worrying. But when you sign your next client and bring in predictable cash flow, Don't forget about working with nightmare clients and have complete choice over who you want to work with, and you'll just feel calm and confident knowing that the acquisition side of your business will always be taken care of and ran by the numbers. So the last thing is a quick implementation plan on exactly how long things will take to get going. So phase one is prepare the vessel, and this typically takes two to three weeks and in most cases, ten to fourteen days. And this includes everything. In terms of getting set up, so collecting the case that is building new offer, optimizing your profiles and creating the outbound campaigns, Right? So this is all it takes to get sent out, to starting results, and beyond this, we launch. Right? So I've ten days, fourteen days, potentially, we launch the campaigns. And theoretically, if messes are going out, bookings can come in. And if bookings can come in, then clients can be signed and revenue can be generated. So this is launching and running the campaigns on email and LinkedIn. And the phase three, again, immediately after phase one, is just optimizing your sales process. So having the dedicated sales from convertible license bookings, adding the pre selling systems, optimizing a process and weekly evaluation with myself or the head of, you know, sales at our company. So I spoke for a long time. Hopefully, I didn't cut out because of the Internet. Do you have any questions?\nSpeaker 0: No. Not in the moment. I think I think you covered everything that I I kinda need to know at the moment. You know, there's kind of I suppose you could go into tactics all the way that you do stuff in respect of, you know, what emails, what messaging might look like? You know, who who you're approaching? Who the kind of, you", "doc_id": "0bafeb85-2a41-4e2e-b153-040253d80d3f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "13503ae0efebe9e4eaffe88e849236310635736cad1bc201cde58826c9568543", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 39749, "end": 44020, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "946e8e21-8522-444b-820a-3c6b34ad2289", "3": "0367acfe-8489-4515-a55b-0e8036eef4c7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0367acfe-8489-4515-a55b-0e8036eef4c7": {"__data__": {"text": "might look like? You know, who who you're approaching? Who the kind of, you know, the sales team are? How are they approaching them? Because obviously, you know, in a in a kind of smallish market like Australia, obviously, our reputation is -- Yeah. Paramount and important. So, you know, I I obviously wanna be sure that, you know, it's the right type of messaging that's going out and so forth. But But obviously, I'm I'm I'm open. You know, I'm open to your system. So, yeah, let's carry on.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent, and I wanna emphasize that everything we do is completely transparent. So if you do wanna see the messaging, if you do wanna adjust the messaging, if you do wanna adjust targeting, that can be done at any point. Right? It's\nSpeaker 0: I'd love to be across it. I'm I'm not somebody that needs to get in the way, but I'd I'd certainly wanna know what was going out. K.\nSpeaker 1: Cool. Yeah. Hundred percent. So this is pretty much the end of the presentation. Obviously, there's, you know, the other details, the good stuff. But before I go on to that, Is there anything that's unclear on the process? Any questions that you might have? I just wanna make sure everything's good before we move on.\nSpeaker 0: No. I'd I'd love to have this video meeting and and the presentation afterwards just to, you know, just just to have a look over or just to kind of think about what you said it. Yeah, at a later time and and just to show my partner as well. And so, yeah, that'd be good.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Not a problem at all. And the last thing I wanna touch on is on the actual messaging, the way we go about this, And I've seen I mean, I see hundreds of messages every day in terms of how people do outreach. And our approach is very, very different. And in the sense, just to give an example, it's because ours is extremely outcome focused. So what we like to do is leverage anything you've done at the as anything you've done in the past as our foundation of the actual outreach. So for example, if you work with a company, you help them to increase efficiency, you know, increase productivity by two hundred percent. This will be the foundation of our messaging. So it's not like we're gonna give them some weird free audit or twelve page PDF to get them onto a call. That's not the case at all. What we like to do is say, hey, we help this, let's say, e commerce brand to generate or increase productivity by five hundred percent then we reach out to, you know, a similar e commerce brand and say, hey, this brand is exactly like yours. We help it to increase productivity by five hundred percent. Would you be open to getting it on the call? We we can explain how we did that for them. Right? It's completely outcome based and it just What it does is because we're not giving away, like, weird PDFs or things to that degree, everyone that comes onto the call is guaranteed to be interested in the outcome and only the outcome. So you're not, you know, to call for people who just came with something free, They're coming on because they're genuinely interested in what you do. So it just adds a layer of qualification that will always be there when you speak to them.\nSpeaker 0: Yep. It's so important. And one thing that from kind of the lead gen agencies or the growth agencies or, you know, paid acquisition. You know, we we haven't really got those stats that, you know, they they live off of, you know. We do a lot of things that, like I told you, on the the first meeting companies that come to us with a problem you know, that they've been using a spreadsheet for five years and they've just outgrown it and, you know, there's a bottleneck and, you know, we need to make them more efficient. So it yeah. I mean, there's, you know, we could look into the time saved and stuff like that and try and get some kind of you know, formula there. But but, yeah, it's not as hard and fast as as those type of companies with the type of stats they", "doc_id": "0367acfe-8489-4515-a55b-0e8036eef4c7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2e14172870ab73b4b6d03669192e081b00112ff8fa1d2ce75a83becdd3456f37", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 44038, "end": 48004, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ffc5a472-8c0e-49fb-8b5b-448fd9ec634b", "2": "0bafeb85-2a41-4e2e-b153-040253d80d3f", "3": "487e4bce-cbf3-4f96-85ce-467fe7d9e1a8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "487e4bce-cbf3-4f96-85ce-467fe7d9e1a8": {"__data__": {"text": "it's not as hard and fast as as those type of companies with the type of stats they use. But yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Think people\nSpeaker 0: are aware of that.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect. I'm so glad you brought that up because I was thinking about this after our last call. And again, it's it's like the fact that you're working in Australia, people see it could see it as a disadvantage. But this again could be another advantage because most people in the development space, they think, yeah, we we don't have any stats. So we just say, hey, I'm a development guy. Five work with us. So what we can do is exactly like you said. If they increase their efficiency, it equates to time saved, And if we take the average, you know, pay for employee in this in the sector of the business, we just multiply that by the time saved. That's revenue side. Yeah. Sure. So, you know, exactly. Yeah. Because you guys are doing an incredibly useful or providing an incredibly useful service to these businesses. So yeah. I think we we'll have a great time with that in terms of -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: the outcomes.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. No. I do. And I think we just need to be a little bit creative in the way that we position ourselves and get across those those outcomes. To to, yeah, to interest, you know, the present you know, the potential kind of buyer. So yeah. That's so totally. And and I think also, I think it's just you you know, I've just I've just left it for a little bit to getting back into the the flow of things as an agency and getting back into it. And we're kind of humming along a little bit in the last couple of months, but you know, having that predictability and and just those those calls, I just feel that we could convert because I've I've got the case studies. I've got the team. I've got the experience. It's just getting in front of people. So so, yeah, if you could provide that Ethan, yeah, we'll we'll be good.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. And the last thing that I just wanna quickly touch on before going to the other, you know, other details is that we don't wanna look at this like we're just generating leads because everything that we do feeds into everything else that we do. So by collecting these video case studies or just one example, by collecting these case studies. It's gonna allow you to book more meetings, but it's also gonna allow you to increase your close percentage. Right? By building out the new offer. It's not just, you know, having new offers. It's also gonna allow you to stand out. It's also gonna allow you to put more meetings. It's also gonna allow you to, you know, close more clients. Have an easier time selling it. So everything just feeds into itself, and it's just gonna get exponentially easier as you go along. And as you get more case, there is more referrals, more, you know, inbound, yeah, that's what I'm saying. Extremely fast growth.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No, that's great.\nSpeaker 1: Right. Cool. So in terms of the details. Before I go to the pricing, I do wanna mention that we also guarantee results. So we guarantee that within sixty nine months, that you will reach our revenue target of helping you add an extra fifty to a hundred thousand per month. Right? And if not, myself, co founder, my partner, the head of sales, your account manager, all the all the reps in the sales team will work completely free until you hit this outcome. So what this outcome entails? Is that you who you will have generated an extra fifty thousand in monthly revenue, and this will obviously be worked out depending on your project size, things to that degree. But either way, you are guaranteed not just to make an ROI, not just to make your money back, but you're guaranteed to make a huge return on your investment because we definitely don't charge, you know, fifty thousand per month.

So obviously, foundational offer creation, niche research, messaging, you know, three k one time, case study videos edited, distributed, repackaged, you know, and sales assets the same with that every single month, two thousand one hundred per month. And outbound LinkedIn team created and managed two, three, for nine months, an outbound email team created managed trained three thousand eight hundred, end to end sales process creation, optimization, three, nine plus two k, software, SOPs, prebuilt templates, hiring everything to that degree, three, six, four, nine or, yeah, three, six, four, nine months. But Obviously, we don't charge that much. The way we structure things is we have two pricing options. Option one is seven thousand eight hundred per month for nine months. And option two is four thousand nine hundred plus nine percent of revenue growth for nine months or per month for nine months and the way that the nine percent works is, you know, in your case because you're offering, you know, software packages, this number can be adjusted actually. But the way we structure things for other clients is that it's four thousand nine hundred per month pertainer, plus a percentage of the first month that they generate with a new client.\nSpeaker 0: That's the first month that sorry. Just just repeat that again.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So with clients that offer a retainer, you know, so they get paid every single month. What we do is we take nine percent off of the first month's retainer. So in cases where there is development or bigger one time fees, what we like to do is take your typical fee So for example, forty to hundred and fifty thousand divided over twelve months so that we get, you know, certain month to month, and then take nine percent off of the first month. I know it might seem a bit complex there. It's easier if it's written down.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. Okay. Alright. So, yeah, let let me I mean, I've I've got questions, but I'm I'm just launches the time now as well because I've got to get get going, but Yeah. Let me let me have a think about it, Ethan.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. No problem. No problem. While I'm here, can I answer any of the questions?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I mean so, you know, you you you're kinda guaranteeing that that fifty to a hundred thousand after six or nine months, but you kind of got like a five grand a month up until, you know, say, six months. So you know, we're looking at at, you know, a fair amount there upfront before we generate some income. So yeah. I I just yeah. It's it's a little bit on the high side for me at the moment. I'm looking at it. To be honest. So, yeah, just wanna wanna kinda look over those figures and and just see how that can can kinda work because Yeah. Really need to. I I thought you might have had a performance option rather than such a big big monthly retainer. Are we talking Australian dollars there?\nSpeaker 1: U. S. Dollars.\nSpeaker 0: U. S. Dollars. Yes. So exchange rates are killer for me at the moment. It's it's huge. So, you know, we're looking at five grand. Can you just put that in? What what what Well, put put in the seven thousand eight hundred. So we're probably looking at, like, thirteen to fourteen grand a month. Yeah. I I'm not gonna be able to afford that, to be honest with me. That that's too high, way too high. So yeah. Let me I'm a bit shocked actually to be honest how high it is. In in US dollars as well. Yeah. So let me let me mull over the if you could send me the video and also your your presentation. Let me let me just have a look at that.

So if you're ready, we can get\nSpeaker 1: right into it. Let's store it, man. Let's store it.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. So how these calls usually go is. I just wanna ask you some questions about you and your business, where you are, where you wanna be. Then if it sounds like you're a good fit, I'll explain our service and how it works. Then at the end, it's a simple decision whether you want to be a part of it or not. That'll go with you. Yeah, man. Suresh. Yep. Perfect. So Josh, tell tell me what motivated you to take this call today.\nSpeaker 1: So we're trying to scale. Basically, we're at, like, decent enough revenue at the moment. We've got good claims. Well, we're just trying to kind of transition out of having a small lower paying claims move towards more higher ticket claims and kind of shooting for quality over quantity as such. So, like, I kinda don't really have time to do the outreach process myself. So I wanted to kinda touch base with you, obviously, to see. Is it something, you know, would it be a good fit? Can we work something out? Can we get highly qualified leads into the pipeline that are, you know, have good intent to play? Unless those that are willing to be sold too, essentially.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. Am I right in saying that you sell email and SMS marketing?\nSpeaker 1: That is correct. Yep. Yes.\nSpeaker 0: So what do you charge for these services?\nSpeaker 1: It's highly dependent on the clients, but usually, probably, anywhere from, you know, nine hundred to fifteen hundred.\nSpeaker 0: Dollars or pounds?\nSpeaker 1: That would be euros.\nSpeaker 0: Euros. Cool. Yeah. And on average, how long does the client stay on board with you?\nSpeaker 1: I have a very good retention rate, so most clients stay on six months plus. So it's very much long term. It's not, like, you know, just in short term, fucking flip them, get them in and and seems really can shoot for kind of long term growth. So as if you if the client grows, you grow alongside it. Mainly focused on, let's say, like, anybody that's doing fifty k plus a month and bringing all those goes to, you know, like, let's say, a hundred and fifty k a month and really scaling that over the business. I don't really look at anybody who's, like, ideally, the sweet spot will be around a fifty k mark. We do take on clients. We've got a couple of clients that are doing, like, you know, twenty seventeen to twenty k a month, but, like, I don't touch anything under, like, anything under fifteen. Really? It's just for compliant list. So, yeah, man.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So what does your ideal client look like? Besides the revenue?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. My ID ID client will be someone obviously on shop before your woofcommerce, which is a key for me to be able to perform. Someone who's actually willing to trust in this process. In terms of niche, I'm pretty open to niche. I work across fitness. A lot of claims for fitness I work across. Obviously, just connect generic e com, hair care, or makeup. So ideally, like, yeah, anything within, I suppose, that space, like, it doesn't matter if it's low ticket, high ticket.

So we're pretty open. Ideal thing would be, obviously, if if I was gonna choose. Fashion cosmetics or fitness, essentially, on Shopify or e commerce doing decent revenue.

Maybe doing something on managing for using Calabrio a little bit, but, yeah, that that will be kind of as essential.\nSpeaker 0: Okay? And can you tell me about your sales process from taking someone from a stranger to a customer?\nSpeaker 1: Course, ma'am. So, like, We do a lot of outreach on, you know, Instagram and we didn't sales process currently is well, I suppose it it's twofold. Right? Firstly, white label services to two agencies. So a lot of leads would come through there as in going you know, they kind of contract out to me. I work on a new agency. So that's how we get\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Yep. -- under the transport in terms of sales process, outreach, Instagram, Facebook. Right? We're literally going from, you know, working into a phone or so trying to get them on a call like this, kind of initial discovery call. You know, understanding their needs, understanding their their requirements, delivering and, you know, as well as some KPIs, kinda showcasing what we can do, how we can increase the revenue from that ten to thirty four percent on an initial basis. And then it's probably, like, you're probably looking at maybe, like, you know, highly dependent, but probably four to six week process if I used to kind of be give a good estimate on it. Maybe a little bit more, but I literally just don't have to tell you, man, like, I'm fully managing fully managing this team of three or four people. You know what I mean? August top of these twenty two clinics. Fairly fucking hectic. So Outreach has definitely taken a back seat as a layaway where you are coming in to the fold.\nSpeaker 0: Do you know your sales closing percentage by any chance?\nSpeaker 1: No, man. No, I have no clue.\nSpeaker 0: That's okay. So currently, besides Instagram outreach and LinkedIn outreach, how else are you getting customers?\nSpeaker 1: Order first, really, my order first. So, like, obviously, we're we're currently with two agencies. Across the UK and Ireland. Mhmm. One's very much focused on the fitness niche. One is kind of generic general e com. Servicing clients all over. So a lot comes from referrals from from those days. This is essentially how we kind of get business outside of that.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So besides the referrals, are you doing all the outreach yourself?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Correct.\nSpeaker 0: Twenty two clients. He must be a busy guy.\nSpeaker 1: Crazy busy man. Yeah. Crazy busy. What look? We're trying to we're trying to kind of transition out some of those lower paying clients. You know, and and get I suppose, I wanna consolidate. I'd love to have, let's say, like, if we're twenty two at a moment, we kind of bones between maybe twenty two and twenty seven. Or you're dependent out there on Black Friday, and you kinda have more, excuse me, to comment on board, etcetera, etcetera for q four. So, like, ideally, I'd love to drop it down to, like, maybe, you know, consolidate around fifteen to sell seventeen clients that are, you know, kind of fucking high ticket, man, that can actually pay prices and all of fucking give a vote.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So just so I can understand the situation fully, do you have a system at all to get customers at all? No. Okay. So now I just wanna ask you some more specific questions just so I can understand exactly where you are and where you wanna be in terms of metrics.

It depends what we're doing between about eleven fifteen k a month. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And in twelve months time, months ago?\nSpeaker 1: Twelve months time, we really wanna be at about fifty k. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: It's a good goal. What's your motivation for getting to fifty?\nSpeaker 1: Bigger team and legacy. Legacy. Yeah, man. So, like, if we can build out a bigger team, if we can get more money in, if we can provide a higher service, if we can get better paying clients, It means that we can equally grow the business higher, I suppose, better people, better designers, better email marketing consultants, better experts. And then you know, obviously, kinda silo each plane so you could have fucking, you know, one team of, let's say, four people to design or whatever else. Copywriter, etcetera. They're managing ten clients themselves, replicate that team. You know, have another team. They're managing another ten clients. Not a fucking you know, ten clients. So, like, what the finance does, the reason it's fifty k is number one. Obviously, we're operating in a very good profit margin. But number two, like, it frees you up to actually put that additional expenditure back into the business for scalability. That's the kind of goal, way fifty k, and then I wanna branch out to actually acquire in brands. So the acquisition of brands as well. So that that, like, that fifty k will be a good metric to kind of free free up a little bit more time to do an acumen and hire the appropriate people and grow the business.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. And how would get into fifty k have an impact on other areas of the life?\nSpeaker 1: Fucking Rolex. Right? I don't know. How will it I suppose getting to that fifty k mark. It just means the proof of concept is fully there. You know what I mean? Business approval model. We have scalability. If you're looking for something like outside investment, it can be, you know, saved money, it can be, I suppose, fucking grabbed from there. If you have the, I suppose, the financial backing, as I said, the proof of concept, the finances to show it, it just opens up a complete different world in terms of actually growing that business to, you know, a million quite a year or a million quite a month. Is ideally where we kinda wanna get to, you know.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So, Josh, you're currently at eleven to fifteen k a month. You're going back to fifty k. What do you think is stopping you from getting down your home?\nSpeaker 1: It's definitely the client acquisition process. The timing and the structure, I think, is key here. You know what I mean? Really building out those processes, but having something that's automated because if I suppose the biggest hindrance at the moment is, like, if if we're looking at, like, white labeling your services to agencies. Right? There's only so much an agency is kind of willing pay, and there's only so much in the agency can put on top of their already existing, let's say, marketing fee that they're charging. So you have to operate at a a slight reduced rate when you're going in under another agency. Whereas if you go direct to clients or, like, direct to consumer, you can charge that, you know, fucking fifteen hundred if you're getting a thirty k and want to just solely come off human marketing. So that's probably the biggest issue. The biggest priority I see at the moment is being too heavy focused on white labeling.\nSpeaker 0: So am I right in saying that if you get clients directly from the market, not from referrals, you keep the or more of the retainer value? Exactly. Correct. Okay. Perfect. So out of curiosity, you're making eleven to fifteen, you're doing pretty well. Why not say we were?\nSpeaker 1: Good to fuck one cigarette. Right?

She might have ties back into election, right, or hundred percent.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. So last question. When are you looking to solve this problem?\nSpeaker 1: Timeline wise, I suppose kind of as soon as possible, you just need to lock down some processes. You know, make sure the team is is in a position where we can actually start taking on those clients. We're most definitely in that capacity. No. Like, definitely get the team to work a little bit harder, you know, but I don't really have a timeline. It's all dependent on a couple of outliers. Number one, fees, cost, and return. You know, I've dealt with a couple of this was kinda closing agencies previously, and it's it's very much paper lead basis. And then they're fucking giving you a lead for a company that has already has an human marketing service. You're jumping on, you're doing consultancy call. There's no intent to bike. And also, it's very dependent on the quality of leads, you know, with is it within our niche to cost our lead and what actually the return is gonna be? I'm quite skeptical, man, to be honest, I used to be in business development there before I got into this for, like, for over six years. So I'm pretty skeptical over the whole sales process.\nSpeaker 0: Well, based on your answers, based on what you told me, I am very confident that we can help you with this. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what we do?\nSpeaker 1: Let's do it, man. One percent.\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So As you might know, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get a lot more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. The ideal agency for us to work with is typically making between eight and twenty k per month with the goal of getting to around thirty to seventy per month. Now these agencies these agency owners specifically, they're doing everything in their business. They are doing outreach, sales, service delivery, etcetera. So we help them to automate their client acquisition, which allows them to stop working in the business, but start working on the business and take more of an ownership role. Our real goal is to build a fully automated client acquisition system that allows you to get consistent meetings with qualified meeting with qualified prospects on demand. Yep.\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\nSpeaker 0: So I can go into a bit more detail if you like.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Let's do it, man. One more sec. So here\nSpeaker 0: I'm logged. To explain our service briefly. The goal, the sole goal, was to get you more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings of prospects in huge need of services. So we'll start by creating a new offer and design a unique messaging that will stand out and attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll use we'll utilize this messaging in highly personalized outreach campaigns. We will target and book meetings with the most qualified prospects for you, this is at least twenty k revenue per month, actually above fifty k at least, like", "doc_id": "d58bfd95-2a24-422f-bbe6-7394fbb9baed", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0489c1f6a7aee920d7b40ec91be0b9538bf5947b3510d8c3d5338a76099575d1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11272, "end": 15165, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "03c2ef01-cb0a-4089-8a19-f8954a3aaf68", "2": "ab6bdb2e-5a34-4d73-85fd-ff352918e934", "3": "4a5fb3fe-35de-445e-a7f1-efa1897b7af4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4a5fb3fe-35de-445e-a7f1-efa1897b7af4": {"__data__": {"text": "least twenty k revenue per month, actually above fifty k at least, like you said.

In addition to this, the entire process from start to finish is one hundred percent done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up the calls with qualified prospects and sell them services that they already want. It's quite simple. And I assume this will help you free up a lot of time for you. So the entire service in conclusion was designed by an agency owner, four agency owners. Looking to break through and systemize the outreach to get to around forty to seventy k per month. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Tell me a little bit more about the business. Are you fully are you an age like, are you the the agency owner? Do you work for for another agency. What's the kind of background?\nSpeaker 0: My background is that I used to run my own agency, an advertising agency, offering Facebook and Google advertising. This was a few years back and I transitioned into helping agency on this.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And how many is on the teams you choose yourself?\nSpeaker 0: No. It's myself in about forty members, but it fluctuates. Because I'm mainly hire contractors and we scale as we take on more clients.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And what's the Outreach process into your messaging LinkedIn messaging. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Combination of cold email and LinkedIn outreach. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Sweet man. Can you send me over a more documentation?\nSpeaker 0: Sure can. What do you need?\nSpeaker 1: I did a full proposal. Please, if you don't mind. I'm probably not gonna be, like, any other person who worked with. As I said, like, I'm a hundred percent open and willing to to to do whatever it takes to get this done. I just need I suppose a little bit more I know you're probably looking for the clothes on the call, but I'm looking for more concrete I suppose. What I want is case studies if you have them? Mhmm. What for proposal? I wanna put a background to you and the team if possible. As well. So just any sales collateral that you have that you can send over. And I know you're probably shooting for the the the clothes on the call for you know, I'd I'd need a little bit more a little bit more sales collateral to lead. This the the process seans exactly what I'm looking for. Ethan to be perfectly honest. It sounds, you know, exactly what we need in terms of this outreach and having that fully automated. I'm just literally showing up to call and it's jumping on. Onto prospects, you know, issues and then just going from there, either closing or not. So within that, let's segue into your pricing. I presume you do you work off a closed commission basis or as a per lead basis? Or how how would you work your commission?\nSpeaker 0: So our fee for managing and holding the system starts with a one time setup fee of three thousand dollars. And from there, it's one hundred dollars per appointment. But after doing this for a long time, we found that people who make decisions quickly always turn out to be the best clients and we get them the best results. So for those reasons, we have something called incentive based pricing where I know you don't like this, but if you make the decision with me today -- Mhmm. -- I've got the setup fee in half, and then it's just a one time setup fee of one thousand five hundred dollars. And one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.\nSpeaker 1: So your real price is fifteen hundred because you just knocked to play fifty percent.\nSpeaker 0: Did I say that?\nSpeaker 1: Well, it was three thousand dollars. I know it's fifteen hundred dollars.\nSpeaker 0: Three thousand dollars if you don't make the decision today.\nSpeaker 1: That's alright, man. Yep. Hundred percent. So that makes sense. Yeah.

What what I will do, Ethan, if you will you please, Semiana Claro? Like, if we have to pay the three k? I have to pray that we get not to push just as long as I suppose we have that trust and, you know, I have a full understanding of what's actually happening at each stage. It will be ideal for me.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. Absolutely. And broke with regards to what you were saying about the one call close. That's not really my intention. Yeah. As I'm sure everyone will say. Bye. I don't really care. Obviously, I care, but I don't care if we close. It's -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- more about actually being able to help.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. As\nSpeaker 0: you see, my entire business model is based around performance. After the setup fees, we don't get you phenomenal results, we don't get anything. So I'm not like you or yourself. You don't wanna work with people for a month and then just flip them. So, yeah, sixty\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. Long term growth, man.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So this isn't some objection handling technique. But since we are in the call, can I answer any questions? Can I give you a better understanding and remove any doubt that you might\nSpeaker 1: have? That's alright. I'll go, man. I I do really appreciate the time. I think you've taught me through, everybody. Definitely like to see a couple of case stories if possible later. You know, maybe anybody that you worked with within the space. Is email marketing something that you kinda specialize in? Or is it you just looking at anybody who's kinda doing, you know, as well as add agencies, etcetera?\nSpeaker 0: We work with all agencies, but email marketing is probably one of my preferred just because the the offer is so much better.\nSpeaker 1: Right, man. It's like no fucking ad spend. Yes. So your monthly and then your whatever your your email -- Yeah. -- monthly.\nSpeaker 0: It's very appealing.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Well, yeah. That sounds brilliant, man. Mhmm. We should say, you know, give me a good insight. You have my email if you wanna send me over that, and then maybe we can schedule a call once I kinda have a review. If I have any questions in the meantime, I'll just drop you a message on LinkedIn, or I will drop you a email that might have some bits and pieces that'll come back to today, later on today.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. There's something I wanna mention on the case side though. Yeah. Because of the cumulative nature of the digital marketing space, of course, we actually can't give out our client's names. Yeah. That's right. This is because if I compared this new way to look, they could just, you know, do the exact thing we're doing. Really? What's saying this? I still really want you to share the confidence that I have in this service. Yeah. And I hope the business model can also speak for itself the fact that we have to get you results. We have no choice but to get you results. And our incentives are completely aligned. So which is why I wanted to mention this about the case studies.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. No. It makes perfect sense. Well, you just expect it as much to be honest in terms of, like, actually not giving away client's names. Mhmm. Probably privileged information. What kind of anything that you can consent collateralized status collateralized, please just send it out to me so kind of a quick review.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. It's great meeting it too.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Your agenda. I really appreciate the time on.\nSpeaker 0: You know what? I will contact you straight away on LinkedIn, and I will email you some more information.\nSpeaker 1: Your gents. I really appreciate it. I'll be back to you later on today.

Hey, Ethan.\nSpeaker 1: Paul. How are you?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Good. Thanks, mate. How are you?\nSpeaker 1: I'm doing excellent, man. Glad to get this call scheduled.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. No. Thanks for taking taking it. And Yeah. No. Good to meet you. I mean, obviously, you've been seeing your content on LinkedIn, YouTube all around the place. Like in what you're saying, and just wondering kind of a little bit more about what you do and how you do it, really?\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. That's great. Yeah. So if you open to it, I can get a start with everything if you'd like.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Fantastic. So, I mean, these goals are pretty straightforward. I just wanna start off by asking some quick questions. Help me understand where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially help you get there, obviously, if you seem like we should not walk you through the entire offer, how it works, and all the next steps beyond that. And then we can go from there. Is that okay with you, Paul?\nSpeaker 0: That's yeah. Absolutely fine. Go ahead.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Alright. Cool. So best place to start. What was the main motivation for? Wanted to take the call in the first place.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So I have I've never done cold email or cold cold outreach at all, really. The business we're a software agency, and we a few years back, we were, you know, just referrals little bit of Google ads. Things things were kind of, you know, ticking along really nicely. And then went off and started to build product and kind of let things slip. Mhmm. And it's only in the last year or so that I've I've just started to get back into the swing of things of getting the agency back up and firing again. So we still make products, but I just want to obviously focus on the agency. We've always had quite a good reputation in Sydney where Australia is most of our clients. And, yeah, it was just a case of looking at different you know, I've just see you know, I'll be completely honest with you. I've I've just seen in the last kind of six months say Twitter, LinkedIn, just, you know, people like yourself and I I love your content. I'm not dumping you in with everybody else. But, you know, just just the results, you know, the the fact that, you know, there's a lot of great tools out there, the fact that you you're reaching the people that you you you wanna reach rather than, you know, the wrong target audience. And then, unfortunately, at the moment, I'm kinda hitting a lot of people which is good in a way. It it's good in some ways and and, you know, in other ways, I could do more of a mix of of clients. So I'm getting quite a few few startups, whereas before I used to have quite a few businesses.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And, you know, I'm still getting the business leads and and we've still got a few quite a few, you know, business clients. But I I'm wanting to see more of the kind of clients that I'm just not seeing in my leads. And I was hoping that kind of cold calling could could get us there to at least get the the door open and have a conversation.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect. That's perfect. So just to recap the last part, you know, one of the major goals is signing more clients, obviously, but more importantly getting in contact with the right people, the people that you actually wanna work with.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Sure. Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Alright? That's perfect. And we'll go into detail about who these businesses are. But the next question I just have is, obviously, the goal is to scale up to sign more clients do you have a a number of clients that you're looking to hit?\nSpeaker 0: A a number that we're looking to hit of clients. Not really. No.\nSpeaker 1: We haven't really talked about", "doc_id": "d30546f5-1b17-471a-956f-e16c555760ba", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "53286fc9283b9453183e5665f03ce146f3dada3ba1620d0210289100f673063b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3826, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8d534b4d-f63f-4a1c-9c39-1ae058114aba", "3": "45e16ce9-26fd-48b0-b9d9-18e24ffc6008"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "45e16ce9-26fd-48b0-b9d9-18e24ffc6008": {"__data__": {"text": "clients. Not really. No.\nSpeaker 1: We haven't really talked about it.\nSpeaker 0: As revenue per month? It's a good question. No, not necessarily slowly. I mean, I I will have to think about that because, you know, I'd like to to obviously measure that and and I'd obviously like to have Foxteli realistic, but quite ambitious goal. So so yeah. I mean, just getting into revenue and how how our business works. I mean, we we go from anywhere to for a client in the first phase of getting the project off the ground anywhere from, say, forty thousand Australian dollars through to hundred and thirty, hundred and fifty thousand Australian dollars.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And that's, you know, that that's getting somebody on board and building the the first product, which take us three to four months. And then, you know, with the nature of our business, those clients end up being fairly sticky. Because, you know, it's quite a long process. You know, there's quite a lot of expertise that's gone into building mobile apps or custom software. And, you know, we we've got a fairly good reputation in respect of, you know, clients hang around and stay with us for quite a while. So So there's that aspect. But getting back to startups, what what what kind of happens with them is if if it doesn't kinda pick off for if they don't get funding, they kinda disappear a little bit. So you kinda put in that hard work real hard yards up front, you know, for three to six months. They haven't really got the money to to go to the next let you know, the next stage. They haven't got the money to to improve the application or you know, in marketing. So it kind of fizzles out, whereas a a business that's got something that that is built for either their customers or employees. There's, you know, obviously, a a need for for them to maintain that. There's improvements normally. And normally, if you're doing a good job, there's other projects within the company that come up. So that that that's my line of thinking at the moment in the type of targets we want. And so I suppose to make it really simple, you know, if we could get two leads, two leads that convert a month, I'd I'd be happy with that.\nSpeaker 1: Do leads a month.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect. Yes. You got\nSpeaker 0: a big smile on your face. Is is that easy?\nSpeaker 1: Everyone tells me I should stop saying that it's gonna be easy on these calls, but I genuinely Yeah. No. No. It's not easy. We're working with another software development company now, FlexLabs. And they're charging very similar amount, you know, between a hundred and hundred and ninety thousand for their projects.\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\nSpeaker 1: And, I mean, we're we're finding it very straightforward. But again -- Okay.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: I can go into more detail on this.\nSpeaker 0: Where where are they based where are they based, Steve?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, so Flex is based in Oh, I know the the cofound he's based in UK. That's the first one.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And\nSpeaker 1: they have team members all over\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Because of their client base. I mean, where where are you getting these kind of where are you getting these leads from? Is it like main one territory?\nSpeaker 1: Oh, no. No. No. No. Well, him or for that company, it's international. They have no real no real limit on who they can work with in terms of\nSpeaker 0: -- Okay. --\nSpeaker 1: potential. Yeah. Great.\nSpeaker 0: And and neither of we, I mean, I've, you know, just so you know, a bit of grounding us. I've got team members here and and in Poland in in Europe. And and I'm also you know, I'm originally from London, so I've got kind of quite quite kind of close ties to to the UK.

So, yeah, I think, you know, we we we wouldn't limit ourselves to Australian based companies. And I'm also, you know, there's we've got the capacity and we're ready to grow. So if that two is what I'm saying is if we convert those that would be great. That number, but if we did four, six, I I you know, it would be fantastic.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So you have the capacity and you're ready to grow. And ideally, we need to get you in contact with more businesses as opposed to start ups because the start ups are It's a bit more unpredictable. There's chance they'll fizzle out if they don't get the funding things to that degree. But businesses, they're more stable. My deal that might have any projects in the future, would that be correct?\nSpeaker 0: That that would be correct. Yes. One one thing with I'd I'd go back with startups sometimes they're quicker to make decisions. Obviously, there's less people there. They haven't got a board to answer to. There's not, you know, different departments. They can usually make a decision. So So, you know, I I think it depends where our offer is and where you're kind of going with this if if you think that it's possible to to hit those two markets or you wanna niche down into one particular buyer persona as such. I'd I'd I'd be led by you and see and see how you wanna go.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect. And the way we usually do it just to give some context is we base who we target off of who we have helped in the past. So do you have studies or past results in any of the yes?\nSpeaker 0: Definitely. So Yeah. There's, you know, there's a global manufacturer that we build a sales application for. There's a rate sky that we've we've just built recently, there's on the startup side, there's like a memory baby book that's just gone out and and getting getting good good response. We also handle the the biggest camping app in Australia. Well, we'll be after this next build. We we built one app for them that's still out there and we just completely rebuilt it with community and -- Mhmm. -- they've also got a whole heap of different things going with it. So so that's that's a really big application on the kind of consumer side. And then on the business side, yeah, there's a lot of different businesses that we've worked with. But as I say, I'm kind of picking up where we were four or five years ago. We we kind of went down that product route that that did okay, and it's still kind of, you know, bubbling along. But now the agency, I've got a great team we've got capacity and I'm ready to grow. And I think when I'm in front of people, I I can convert them. It's really just down to, you know, well, there's normally a number of factors, but -- Mhmm. -- you know, you've got to convince people that that, you know, you've got team. And you've also got the, you know, the yeah. If I'm dealing with somebody in the UK, they're gonna wanna talk somebody on the u in the UK on on those on that time time zone. So but there's no not a problem for us to hire people, you know. That that's not\nSpeaker 1: a problem. These are all the things I love to hear on these calls. All the things I love.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No. Totally. No. We're we're we're ambitious. And you know, we we know that we can do the job and deliver it's really getting those leads and and that's what I've I've kind of it's really funny because the way the business I suppose it's got got more competitive like like most businesses over time. But four or five years ago, because we were, you know, really into, you know, the agency and the agency was flying along, we were getting lots of good leads coming into us organically and referrals. And that kind of dried up when we stopped, basically. So, you know, it's a case of reigniting that again and getting that off the ground, and that's what we're prepared to do.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Hundred percent. So you have the capacity. You're ready to", "doc_id": "ec55b3e9-69fa-4613-a5f3-5e23666a7ef3", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "54a1f62e971a30106a075f78869fe8fc42d0ca27d10531a2f80a6f6298d87610", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7536, "end": 11479, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8d534b4d-f63f-4a1c-9c39-1ae058114aba", "2": "45e16ce9-26fd-48b0-b9d9-18e24ffc6008", "3": "d298cc30-1e89-4b67-8a94-8ba6363d7b7e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "d298cc30-1e89-4b67-8a94-8ba6363d7b7e": {"__data__": {"text": "1: Yeah.

You have the team and you understand how to hire for the roles, and you can convert slash, you can sell it. We can just get you on con like, in contact with these audio prospects. Yep. You have everything. So the goal would be to sign two clients a month at around forty to a hundred thirty thousand. And the only thing stopping is just speaking to enough qualified prospects every day?\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Alright. Cool. And then I just wanna get some context on the actual pricing. So I know you mentioned the first space is around forty thousand to a hundred and thirty thousand. Do you charge that upfront? Do you split it out over months? Is it a retainer?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Spill it. Spill it out over months. So so yeah, I mean, is probably ten percent to fifteen percent taken as a a commencement fee. Mhmm. And and then it split over split over milestones really, project milestones. Oh, so that that sounds good.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That's perfect. Alright. Cool. And then another thing I wanted to ask is because it clearly sounds like you have an amazing business here already. How are you currently attracting clients right now?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So at the moment, I'm not doing any I'm not doing any Google ads. The website is not converting. I I I need to step that up. So I'm using I'm using a a service that that basically don't know whether you're aware of it, bark at all. No. No. They're a UK company. UK company. And you know, they're they're basically, you know, they'll come up with first and and, you know, you put out developers, they'll be up there, you know, paid ads\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And the way they work is they they charge a, you know, I think it's probably thirty to forty dollars a lead. Mhmm. But those leads are quite I've had some good leads and some really interesting projects, but you've really got to get through them. I mean, the conversion rate is quite small and it really is not down to, you know, me being shit at sales or, you know, the team or anything like that. It it really like people that oh, I thought an app cost five thousand dollars or, you know, they're really kind of quite unqualified leads.\nSpeaker 1: And\nSpeaker 0: that's what I found really frustrating because I'm used to dealing with people that one know what they wanna do in respect of, you know, they'll come to us for recommendation but they're very serious about what they're looking to do. Whereas the a lot of these leads are people that have, you know, got an idea that's come to them on a Friday night. They put something out at the weekend, then they think it's gonna cost ten grand to build an application that looks like Instagram.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So it's you know, it's very different. But saying that, there is some interesting, really interesting projects that come through that. So It's something that I'm I'm just kind of living with and referrals as well. Referrals we we still get, you know. Cool. So so that's always a good thing.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I mean, that's just another indicator that you're graded what you guys do if you're growing from the referrals. Which is another Yeah. I'm sorry.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We that's just been steady. So so I just wanted something a bit bit more predictable in respect that you know, predictable in in the quality of the leads. That's what I mean more more than, you know, not after quantity.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: I I'd I'd really kind of want and I know it's a hard game in what you guys do in respect that it's cold outreach and stuff. But if, you know, if if it does come down to, you know, having conversations with people that are serious about, you know, building something, then then we we can certainly be", "doc_id": "d298cc30-1e89-4b67-8a94-8ba6363d7b7e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "68409210441bca71ee51d7da9b3a029efecfa988957489d110ae5fd27437df4b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11472, "end": 15353, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8d534b4d-f63f-4a1c-9c39-1ae058114aba", "2": "ec55b3e9-69fa-4613-a5f3-5e23666a7ef3", "3": "a11e63d0-01f5-48c6-849a-29590b97b2c4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a11e63d0-01f5-48c6-849a-29590b97b2c4": {"__data__": {"text": "people that are serious about, you know, building something, then then we we can certainly be in the mix.

I've been very experienced in in that field that I've worked in. And I feel that, you know, we we can normally win it. It's just a case that we we with the bigger clients, we might lose out to somebody that's you know, they've got the bigger higher ticket kind of, you know, brand logos, you know, whereas, you know, we've we've got some big ones off now, but Again, that was work that we did four or five years ago. It's hard for me it's hard for me to pull on a couple of those, whereas, yeah, you've obviously got some some of our competitors are, you know, dealing with the the top guys. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: A hundred percent of the quality is actually a very important factor as opposed to just, you know, calls off the calls off the calls because, I guess, with the bark, you might be paying thirty dollars to forty dollars per lead. That's not a lot, but it's also the time that you spend on these calls.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: If you only cause yourself, you probably have a lot of other things to do and by wasting it to you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: I do. I mean, I think, you know, there's yeah. It it's really the follow ups. Yeah. You know, it's getting to qualify. I'm qualifying people a lot earlier, so I'm I'm kind of discounting a a lot of leads as early as possible. You know? I I don't mind frightening people with price because that is our price. We we're not gonna be changing that, you know. So, you know, and but then also there's the thing that we don't really software is something that it's not so easy to be able to go. Yep. That's gonna cost you forty grand. It's like, you know, there's a lot of scoping and understanding what people want and people don't always necessarily know what they want and saying something to me over the phone or or, you know, to discovery calls. It's very different to mapping it out on a whiteboard and understanding what kind of, you know, from a technical point of view is required. So, yeah, it's it's something that is interesting in that respect, but also kind of, you know, it's not It's not a hard and easy commodity that you just go, okay, we'll wear fifty k, guide down the road, sixty k, you know, it's there's a lot more into it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's a lot more complexity.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Totally. And getting getting and that and that's all about the discovery. And and that also gives you another you know, me and our team because I I have had these calls with my CTO as well in getting to understand whether we're a good fit, you know, whether, you know, they're a good fit for us and and we're a good fit for them and and that seeing what the the the relationship is. So I I don't mind having those those kind of calls when they're serious calls, you know. Yeah. We'll we'll spend our time having a narrow workshop. For for a job that could be worth, you know, lifetime value of, you know, two hundred thousand, you know, that that's more than worth our while to do that.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly. Like, you're willing to invest the time if you know that they're actually serious and they're actually qualified because then it's an amazing. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Besides services like Bak and obviously grown from referrals, Have you tried anything else to acquire clients?\nSpeaker 0: No. Nothing else at at the moment. You know, it's a long time ago. I said, it was it was kind of Google AdWords. There was some content marketing. There was kind of, you know, email magnets on their website. Sorry. You know?

Sorry. You know? All types of, you know, email marketing in that respect, which was all kinda quiet, done at, you know, not not in a serious way. So so this is you know, I had to chat with somebody around kind of, you know, LinkedIn marketing in respect of, you know, hunting for for clients on that. And and kind of ghost writing. I didn't take up that offer. I I wanted to to write for myself, which I've started to to do over the last kind of three or four months. So, yeah, it's something that's cold yeah. I was looking yeah. And I was also looking at doing it myself, but I I kind of felt that I needed that push of somebody that knew what they were doing.\nSpeaker 1: That's such a smart choice. Right? I can't tell you how many times I hear that same thing. You know, they wanna try it themselves. And then they do and they waste like four years and they still don't figure it out. So the fact that you even say that just indicates a level of self awareness that most people don't need, which is Yeah. Because on that point, specifically about the quality of the quantity and the needing of predictability. It's the exact same situation as Flex, the other development company, I was talking about earlier, another one of our clients. And for them, generally, they only need one deal potentially every month. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yep. The thing for us is to get them in contact with, for example, seven, eight, nine figure e commerce brands. And, you know, if we can just do that predictably, you know, closing is pretty much inevitable. Something we could just use extremely similar approach for you as well, you know, only getting conquered in contact with seven figure eight figure nine figure brands. And businesses as opposed to start ups if that's what your ideal prospect is, and we can go after anyone.\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\nSpeaker 1: But it shouldn't be very complex in terms of delivery.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. That that that that all sounds great.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool. So\nSpeaker 0: I think in I mean, the one one thing that you it has just got me thinking about flags is is that they've gone they've they've niche down in this specific that it's e commerce brands that they've gone forward, which is great because, you know, that that's what they're known for and and makes everybody's you know, the messaging, everything easier whereas we are quite diverse in in the client base that we've got. Custom software lends that self to it because, you know, everybody could have custom software. You know, it's it's something that you know, and and the way that and just to give you an idea of that kind of type of business customers that will come to us is they'll have internal processes that have just got you know, they'll be using spreadsheets for, although cobbled together two or three off the shelf and applications. That have worked up to a point, but then suddenly, you know, it it gets all clunky and, you know, they can't query the database like they need to. They can't do things that require, you know, proper kind of, you know, in the field applications or at least other things. And and that's the kind of, you know, problem that we solve is is kind of putting those things together. So and and we've got quite a varied mix of of kind of clients that we've worked for in that in that line of work. And and you don't steer a lot of it on our side and you don't you see that in the app or people say, well, what what actually got? Because there are business apps that are used primarily for internal reasons, you know, mainly for employees. You know, more so than leaving customers. You know, it's fixing a problem that, you know, the employees have got with that, you know, So, yeah, that that's the type of things that we get asked, you know, how group business is to to work on. Mhmm. And we love that stuff because we can really get our teeth into it and really improve I see an improvement kind of pretty soon -- Mhmm. -- with that with that type of solution.\nSpeaker", "doc_id": "7f6d44fe-26f5-48eb-8297-c7d4a25ead31", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5db3ca7a3999e3285436d2e5e01c7ae731e6e088936fe3172b31e7e15d0cca8e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19168, "end": 23213, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8d534b4d-f63f-4a1c-9c39-1ae058114aba", "2": "a11e63d0-01f5-48c6-849a-29590b97b2c4", "3": "4bd2b44b-3601-4834-a7de-0c93d0dd2997"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4bd2b44b-3601-4834-a7de-0c93d0dd2997": {"__data__": {"text": "pretty soon -- Mhmm. -- with that with that type of solution.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. I I always end up noting out about things like this, like processes and spreadsheets and stuff. So this is perfect to me. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Good.\nSpeaker 1: So just so I know I heard it correctly, the main outcomes that you provide is helping the businesses with inefficient processes, they're using thousands of spreadsheets or, you know, stuck together with duct tape, and you're helping to really streamline this systemize it, put into, you know, a nice app that the employees can use, increase efficiency, things of that degree.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Exactly. That that's the type of thing that we we do and we do do very well. And yeah. And and when you think about it, every business gets to that point at some stage, especially if they're growing. And and, you know, that that's and, you know, they've had these things together for years that have worked and then suddenly they don't when they go from ten people to fifty people to fifty to a hundred, you know. So so that's where we come on board.\nSpeaker 1: Under the same. Oh, that's perfect. Okay. Cool. So just to recap everything, it seems like you genuinely have all the foundations ready. You have the capacity. You have amazing case studies. You have a great team. You can clearly solve at least, you know, even just based on this co identity you can solve. The goal is to get, you know, two clients per month, charging at least forty to a hundred and thirty thousand for the project. And the only thing stopping you from signing these clients is just speaking to enough qualified prospects on a daily basis that can afford what you're offering. That know what you offer, that understand software doesn't cost five k to look like Instagram. You know, if you can just get in contact with these prospects every single day, and scale will be pretty much inevitable. Does that sound reasonably close to the situation?\nSpeaker 0: So that that that would be close some would be a a situation that I'd be very happy to achieve. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Okay. Cool. I mean, based on that, you're like ninety nine percent of our past clients. We've seen great results. Do you mind for sure what the next steps would be?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Please do. Yeah. Yeah. Really interested. I mean, I was I was kinda not not concerned because I I I saw that you did agency stuff, but I I was thinking, you know, is it kind of smaller offers with marketing agencies that are you know, a five grand a month retainer or a ten grand a month retainer, which which is great. But but we're a very different type of solution.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Oh, a hundred percent. Hundred percent, especially in the sales process. But, like, we've got tons of experience in, you know, these sort of projects as well. It's not necessarily a 2K retainer over twelve months. That's much bigger projects, much longer potentially sales process, sales cycle. So perfectly fine. Yeah. So to give a quick overview of what we do is that we help establish marketing agencies to on average increase revenue by fifty to one hundred thousand a month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we're helping to solve is client acquisition. Right? Across the board, across all industries, across all niches that all face such a similar problem, and it's just that they can't acquire clients predictably. Right? So they have all the foundations already. They have capacity. They have the team. They have great case studies. They can sell They're just not speaking to enough qualified and emphasis on qualified prospects every single day that can afford what they're offering that want, what offering and that need what they're offering every day. And if they can do that, they can solve that one problem, then scale is extremely straightforward.

On a client call, which could go on for a little. It would certainly be an hour and a half. And then then I might have my son's basketball game afterwards depending on when the the court finishes. So I'm interested to have this though. Is that where where about you based?\nSpeaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now, but I understand the time zone difference. We could even do an hour earlier. Yeah. This is what\nSpeaker 0: I was thinking. The time zone is a difference. Yeah. Yes. So so this call will know. This call will probably be be between five PM and six PM for me and could go on for an hour and a half. We I'll just tell you briefly. It's it's that it's the camping app that I told you about that we've completely rebuilt, say, yes, seven months seven months to build and it and it's the last week of getting to the final version. So it's all everybody's a bit touchy because it's been so long and, you know, it's one of those where the meeting could could go on. Everybody's on board for the meeting. So, yeah, it could be one. But let me let me have a think.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfectly fine. Come back\nSpeaker 0: to you on that one. Well, actually, I don't want you you to fill up your your your schedule. So so when you say an hour earlier, we we started at eight seven seven PM. What's the time there now? What what is the the difference?\nSpeaker 1: I'm not sure what the difference is, but it doesn't really matter\nSpeaker 0: to me. No. So so yeah. No. What what what's your What's the time now? What what's your time?\nSpeaker 1: It's eleven thirty AM time. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Eleven thirty AM. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: So if our earlier upload doesn't work, then we can set up another time for next week. It's not a problem at all. Then I'll just send over a calendar link and we can go from there.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Let's let's do that because I think tomorrow, I my head will be spinning as well after this year. Yeah. Yeah. Can you Has it? That'll be fine.\nSpeaker 1: Alright. Cool. I'll send the link on LinkedIn straight after this call. But, Paul, it was honestly a pleasure speaking. Great learning about your business team.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Very likewise.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So in terms of the proposal between now and then, either myself or someone on the team will reach out just to confirm everything, check everything's good. And then on that call, what I'll start by doing is going through a ton of case studies of agencies very similar to yours. Our exact process that you could genuinely do this with or without us and then all the additional details like pricing, how to get started, things to that degree. Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That will sounds great. Yep. That's perfect.\nSpeaker 1: Fantastic. Cool.

So Jay, tell me, what made you wanna come on this call today?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I think want to know a little bit more about what you do, like, as an appointments there. Mhmm. Like, right now, I'm just doing most of my I've done all day to reach myself. So it'd be good to see, like, what your processes and, you know, like, at one point or another, I would like to fill it, like, outsource this part of the business, and because it is very time consuming.

So how's the outage going?\nSpeaker 1: It's it's hard. It's it's okay some days. It's like, you know, you'll go like a little bit and you get nothing back. Like, absolutely nothing. And then you'll have, like, a day where you might be, like, booked three or four meetings. But it's, like, it's not consistent. And It's just it's just one of those things I guess. Like, right now, I'll mainly just do an email and lengthen every reach. And But I was basically doing me. No worries. I'm doing it right now.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. A lot of people tell me that inconsistency is so demotivating. Getting nothing on Sundays. It feels like a waste\nSpeaker 1: of time.\nSpeaker 0: Like, it was I\nSpeaker 1: think it's the late the especially the best email it reaches. It's, like, really scalable, which is good. And, like, once you get a process done, it can really work. But right now, that I've got, like, one of my clients, he says that he gets, like, maybe, like, ten to fifteen emails per day. By people that's doing the exact same service. So, like, it's really hard to, like, stand out. And I think that's the the main thing with email was, you know, you're just getting put an analyst with another bunch of people that's pitching the exact same services. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: That's true. Am I right in saying that you offer paid ads?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Paid ads. So we primarily do Facebook ads. But we're we do, like, some YouTube and Google ads as well. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And how do you price for services?\nSpeaker 1: So it depends, like, right now, we've only we've only got two clients right now, but one of the clients is on, like, a robust only deal. So we just take a percentage just like ten percent of return on ad spend on Facebook ads. And then the other person, we've got them on YouTube, Google, and Facebook. And that's our first six hundred and fifty pound retainer.\nSpeaker 0: Will your prices stay like this? Or do you have something in mind?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. They'll probably stay like that.

And if there's room to do, like, a raw steel, I would prefer to do that because, like, when we get the the other game scaled up, it's better for me, obviously. And -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: and a lot of people prefer, like, the the performance basis as well because there's, like, a lot agencies that are just, like, taking big chunky retainers and they don't really they don't really care about the that show service delivery. So -- Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: but it's pitching them on, like, a a performance deal. They they tend to prefer it.\nSpeaker 0: True. And what does the ideal customer look like?\nSpeaker 1: So right now e commerce businesses, preferably with, like, a revenue between fifteen and twenty five k, roughly about that. And they sell, like, basic, anything, e commerce related, anything product related. I was pretty much trying to stay away from my end full product.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. So can you tell me about your sales process?\nSpeaker 1: So the full sales process from email outreach, a specific email outreach, we'll send the email once they book a call is back, like, yourself with the link, then we'll send them over and ask them if they prefer a time or we'll send over the calendar invite. Once we jump on at the call, we just it's kinda like what we're done here. We'll just run through the where they are in the business right now. We really want to get to that's pretty much just trying to build up a little bit of a relationship with them. And then go through the service that we provide. And, yeah, that's pretty much true. It's I've got like a structure in the calls, but I tend not to just stick to the structure to like, regular stuff. That makes sense. We just try and, like, build up of a bit of a relationship and just chat to the business owner. And then I'll I'll have, like, certain hoops that we'll need to jump through if you're I'll ask them about the revenue, ask them about the profit margins and all that kind of stuff.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So right now, you said you're using email and LinkedIn How else do you currently get customers? Was that the only way?\nSpeaker 1: That's the only way right now.\nSpeaker 0: So this including that, do you have a system or process that you use to get customers consistently?\nSpeaker 1: No. Not really. That's basically it. So it's just all outbound outreach.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. That's fine. So would you be comfortable in saying that Outreach and client acquisitions, the biggest bottleneck in the business?\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. So now I just wanna understand exactly where you are and exactly where you wanna be using some sort of metrics. So how much money are you currently making per month for this business right now?\nSpeaker 1: Probably around twelve twelve hundred pounds.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. And in twelve months time, what's the goal?\nSpeaker 1: Ten thousand.\nSpeaker 0: Ten thousand? Nice. What's your motivation?\nSpeaker 1: Just like the the ability to just work for myself, basically. And, like, choose when and how I work and, obviously, I have an Aflex validate to, like, go on holidays whenever I want or, you know, basically, I work on Math. I I can take calls when I want to. I can work when I want to. Obviously, right now, it's not like that. It's I'm working even more than I was in my last job, but That is the motivation and that's where I want to get the\nSpeaker 0: freedom. Right?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Makes it out.\nSpeaker 0: Cool.

And then, yeah, just keep on buying and getting hopefully, have k a two media buyer run by the time we get to ten k -- Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: and, like, a couple of years just to do some, like, admin stuff and that's pretty much it. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. A lot of agency owners say, telling me that their big goal is to transition into more than owner. Instead of working in the business, they wanna work on the business, automate a lot of lead gen. Would that be the same for you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Right now, like, with my lead gen, that's like another thing. It's I pay for, like, a thousand leads and that costs me three hundred pounds. Wow. And don't get me wrong, like, I've I've paid Like, there's loads of different lead generation people that I've used, and they like, the first one that I had, they were sending me, like, contact details for, like, Tiffany and Co. And I was like, oh my god. Where is this? Yeah. They and but the the leads were pretty pretty shut, to be honest with him. But this guy is, like, he goes through an old check, like, how many adds the runner on Facebook. So it does take about time, but it's the price that I'm paying. And if I if I'm paying three hundred pounds for a thousand leads, you know, I expect to get a bunch of meetings from that. And right now, like, the meeting birthday is for every hundred leads I get. As maybe one. I think it's, like, point seven percent. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And that's just a meeting.\nSpeaker 1: That's just a meeting. Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I definitely wanna talk on that a bit later. Yeah. Yeah. So ten thousand dollars a month. Sounds great. How would it impact other areas of your life?\nSpeaker 1: I mean, if we got to there, I mean, that's just, like, It would be a proper life changing, you know. It would be just\nSpeaker 0: yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Take my girlfriend to whatever she wants to go, treat my family. Like, that's that's the, you know, it'd be like completely financial security.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's a agency dreamer.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: That's nice. So you're currently at twelve hundred, you wanna get to ten thousand. What do you think stopping you from getting that on your own?\nSpeaker 1: I think it's a bunch of different stuff. One thing is obviously the client acquisition part of it. The I would say that's the main thing. It's not me getting clients, basically. The for them and I've worked that up in or in Outreach, feel like the the results aren't really should be. I'm not sure if it's done to, like, the systems or just the competitive nature of the business because there's absolutely hundreds of agencies over there. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. So I just have a few more questions. So you currently have twelve hundred. Why not just continue and stay where you are?\nSpeaker 1: If I continue and still with Alarm, I'll probably need to go back and get another job because I'm a like, right now, it's, like, that's just covering, like, the bows.\nSpeaker 0: You\nSpeaker 1: know, it's, like, right on the edge. So I I I basically can't stay around.\nSpeaker 0: Must be pretty stressed on it.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.

Have been that that's where I can relate. But anyways, when do you wanna fix this problem?\nSpeaker 1: M basically as soon as possible.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. Well, based on your answers, based on what you told me, I definitely think that I could help you with this.\nSpeaker 1: Would you\nSpeaker 0: like me to tell you a bit more about what we do?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, man. I'll just go for it.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So at my company, Our area of expertise is helping agency owners to get more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. The ideal agency for us to work with is typically just starting out or between zero and seven thousand dollars per month with the goal of getting to somewhere between nine and thirty thousand dollars per month. Typically, these agency owners do everything in the business themselves. They're doing sales. They're doing service delivery. They're doing outreach. So we are going to free up time or to make lead generation and take more of an ownership role, which usually gives them a lot more freedom than they have before. So based on what you told me, I definitely think you'd be a phenomenal fit for what we're doing. Yep. You have any questions?\nSpeaker 1: No. Yeah. That's not you touched on there about the freedom part and working on their business. Like, the ideal part would be just and short very short term what I would like to do. Like, right now, it's like you said, to all out of each sales, everything. Like, right now, what I would love to do is just have meetings, then service delivery. Meetings, service delivery. That is the the short term goal.\nSpeaker 0: That's great. Yeah. That's the figure I could help them to do.\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: Say anything else?\nSpeaker 1: Sorry. Did you ask sorry. Did you ask a question now?\nSpeaker 0: No? No. No. Usually, people just usually after I tell them a bit more about what we do, they usually have questions. So I'm just, like, in case you have anything you want to know.\nSpeaker 1: Nah. Just I'm interested to know, like, what the what your your methods are, like, of actually getting the the calendars booked and, like, filled up.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. No problem. Yeah. I'll explain the entire process. Wonderful. We've got time. So we'll start. Okay. Let's start at the beginning. This service was created with one goal in mind. To get you more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings with prospects in huge need to be service, So we'll start by creating a new offer and designing unique messaging that will stand out from the hundreds and thousands of other agencies. And attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll utilize this messaging and highly personalized outreach campaigns where we'll target in book meetings with the most qualified prospect. Plus is completely organic, meaning we don't have to pay any money on ads or funnels or anything like that. So in addition to this, The entire process from start to finish is completely done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up to calls with qualified prospects and just sell them on services that they clearly one. Yeah. And, yeah, the entire service was designed by by an agency owner, four agency owners looking to break through and systematize the outreach.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. The when you use the as a as a email or as a LinkedIn or do you have, like, another another way that you do it?\nSpeaker 0: We use a combination of email and LinkedIn.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. And in terms of, like, monthly like, targets for new guys. Like, how much how many how many we'd do will you guys contact and, like, say, a month?\nSpeaker 0: You wanna know how many we contact or how many meetings we expect?\nSpeaker 1: Like, how many how many leads you with contact?\nSpeaker 0: It varies because we can scale the service up and down. So it's it's variable in that in that space. But I don't know if you saw", "doc_id": "bb01173c-d517-4119-98d9-53f9af3f1607", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a3e3ec6e683b5e184edb59e5176b08e7a56f69c8cd4e2fc3e06511086ae44709", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 10981, "end": 14929, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "5b23431e-4ce2-4e7d-a6ad-a56458f7ff1c", "2": "e4eeff3b-dd98-496e-b763-dff0fe22b4c0", "3": "ed49b121-223e-42a3-a3e5-a50688bed4b2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ed49b121-223e-42a3-a3e5-a50688bed4b2": {"__data__": {"text": "So it's it's variable in that in that space. But I don't know if you saw I changed my LinkedIn recently to up to add our new offer. Updated off of that. We've been running for months now. Right. This gives a bit more detail where we expect fifteen to thirty five meetings. Within the first sixty or thirty days. So within sixty to thirty days, we expect to see between fifteen and thirty five meetings per month.\nSpeaker 1: Right. Perfect. Right now, I'm getting, like, an average of, what, two weeks. So Two or three a week, maybe. So, like, six. So that's way more. Where is that in your LinkedIn? Or is it just what you said doing, basically?\nSpeaker 0: Basically, what I said. I just updated my profile. Like, we've been running with this offer for months now. I just never changed it.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So what is the what is the price? I I noticed that you guys have got the the paper results. So what's obviously, I know that would be quite hard for, like, your business model because if it's paid per per results is that paid on meetings or does that?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, yeah. My favorite question. So, yeah, it's paid per meeting. Similarly to how you guys do ROS. So only when you get meetings with qualified prospects you pay, but I should explain the entire pricing. It'll make more sense. So a fee for building and managing the system is a one time setup fee of one thousand five hundred dollars From there, it's one hundred percent completely pay on results. So you only pay when qualified prospects show up to the calls. And from this one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.\nSpeaker 1: Right. And the one so the one time service fee, that's like that's not like or that's just one month?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. One month. Right. One time. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: And I suppose I and, like, that would that's full, like, lead generation. Totally. Oh, I mean, you guys take care of them.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You literally just have to show up the calls.\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, man. It does sound good. Well, hey, how how many guys you use? What number three? No. If you got, like, I don't know what it's a case studies because it's not, like, a case study, but, like, results that you've gotten with an agency so far\nSpeaker 0: Well, based on the offer that I mentioned, fifteen to thirty five, this is based on what we've seen. So when you first started, it was just we help you get meetings. But now it's we have some data behind it. Yep. That's what we see. And as you know, with the cumulative nature of the digital marketing space, this is why we can't actually post clear testimonials of our clients.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Because\nSpeaker 0: our competitors knew where to look. They could literally just, you know, copy it. So yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good, man. That sounds good. The only problem I have right now is, obviously, revenue. It's hard because I really do I do it.\nSpeaker 0: Now, this has happened in the past, and because of this, we've created a a semi system that might be helpful to you. Do you want me to explain that?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So instead of paying the entire full on setup fee today, What we've done in the past is we've allowed our clients to split it up into two or three months if that's required. So instead of one thousand five hundred dollars today, it could be seven fifty over two months or five hundred over three months. Mhmm. Perfect.\nSpeaker 1: I'm gonna I'm gonna be honest. I'll probably not be able to make a decision right now, but really interested. I would probably just need to go and think about yeah.

I'm probably gonna need to think about it, but I'm really interested. I would just need to go and sort out how many like, how much it would cost, like, because if if we paid the say, we did split it up in the three months. For the for that service fee. But then on top of that, see how see you do something and then, like, there I've got, like, fifteen meetings. It's, like, the initial payment of the hundred dollars per meeting, if that makes sense. You know what I mean? Be faint once I've got, like, say, I've seen up to them. You know what I mean? Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And If you'd like, we could since we I should explain that we once you sign up, we have, like, twenty four seven communication. You can message me at any time. So if you really need, we can slow things down or speed things up depending on what you'd prefer.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 0: I got a message at any time.\nSpeaker 1: Right. So I like, if we were doing something like that and you're, like, like, if we could probably make your job a lot easier as well. Instead, they're, like, they can, like, say, fifty meters or, like, what if we aim for, like, ten? Do you know what I mean? And then That sounds good, man. And listen, I'm gonna It's already I forgot how I think about this.\nSpeaker 0: How long do you need?\nSpeaker 1: Probably I could Probably just today. I've got yeah. I probably just today. If I give you a message tomorrow, and we could probably just jump on another call tomorrow if you're free.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So do we find that we can schedule a follow-up call for tomorrow?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. That's cool, man. If you you want me to send do you wanna send me another account in the little link?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. No problem. I'll send it to LinkedIn right now.\nSpeaker 1: No worries.\nSpeaker 0: Same time for it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Same times go with me.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. And since you have me here, Do you have any questions?\nSpeaker 1: I'm more trying to think. So because so I've got two quenched right now. And, unfortunately, the both of them have so I've had to I've had SINA and NDA with them. So we don't actually have, like, a a case study. Would that be a problem?\nSpeaker 0: It would affect the results.\nSpeaker 1: But, yeah,\nSpeaker 0: are you able to Do you think you'd be able to just use their result? Don't have to mention many names. Just the number.\nSpeaker 1: I can definitely speak to them and and see what we can do. I also I'll jump on a call with one of them later on today. And see if we can just use the results. They were really funny about it for some reason. That's, like, that's one of the things that it's it's just so weird because it doesn't have anything to do with them. You know what I mean? Yeah. I was like, oh, block out all the ads and everything. They're like, boom.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So because this happens a lot, I've had a couple of clients in the past where we couldn't use the actual name of the brand, but we just use the numbers.

They don't have any clients for any results.\nSpeaker 0: So like I said in the first point, we completely create a new offer that's extremely appealing. And -- Yep. -- a lot of the times have done work in the past. So they are able to add some sort of guarantee. If I had no guarantee, no case study just starting out, I probably wouldn't take them on. But since they have experience and they can guarantee something, it's still able to get meetings.\nSpeaker 1: What a what kind of guarantees do you do? Like, right now, like, some of the my email I reached have, like, split it up and then I was saying some leads I guarantee and then some leads I don't and, like, so the guarantee that I was doing was, like, a a return on investment within within one month or you don't pay the service fee. So, like, do you build the offer? Is it structured similar to that?\nSpeaker 0: Similarly, yeah. We have a entire framework for creating a new guarantee.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 0: So I'll show you that as soon as you sign up. We get started on that. Because that helps so much in -- Yeah. -- meeting meetings. You're offering\nSpeaker 1: a guarantee. Yeah. I can imagine. No. That sounds good, man. What else was it gonna say though? Or do you so in terms of, like, just booking a meeting that I need to have jumping on a call where, like, an appointment set up before neighbors want me to create, like, a VSO. Do do you guys do anything like that? Or Is that something that you would do that is not like needed?\nSpeaker 0: It's not needed. It in the future, I was actually this is actually part of the six month plan. I was planning on implementing that as an optional thing for clients. Because it would it would speed things up. But to start off, I would always do completely organic just to get a proof of concept first.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That makes sense. That makes sense. That's good morning. Perfect. No. I think that's pretty much it. I would just go only to kinda look at the figures and, hopefully, I can move forward with this because it does sound good.\nSpeaker 0: But I'm I'm so excited at the possibility of helping you out.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. As a good one. It's just, like, the obviously, like, what you're saying is basically exactly what I want, like, just to be able to jump on calls, book people in, So with a minute, do the service delivery because, like, outreach is I'm probably doing, like, like, crazy numbers of overreach right now.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: And that's I I know that it the results could definitely be better. But yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's it's the natural progression of an agency owner. Like, at some point or another, you're gonna outsource the outreach. So why don't you just do it\nSpeaker 1: at the start? Yeah. Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: Like, save yourself all the pain of unresponded messages.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. I get it, man. That's cool. Perfect, man. Right. Well, listen. I will let you go right now, and I'll I'll book an for tomorrow. And just at the same time, and I'll speak to you tomorrow.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, man.

I appreciate it's quite short notice. We only spoke on Friday. Mhmm. As I said on LinkedIn, it was very, very well timed because we've recently cut ties with our old VA. So essentially, what we were using it for. So my business model run a digital marketing agency that specializes in scaling e commerce brands through TikTok, so through organic TikTok. Yeah. So we put together, like, unique growth strategies. There's there's a whole heap of research that goes into it as you can understand for the niche of the product that we're working with But but, essentially, in short, the service that we offer is organic growth on TikTok. And obviously, in line with growing on TikTok, you're increasing brand awareness, and our main goal is to drive traffic to our client's website click through rights from from TikTok. Now we do offer email marketing or we can we can do pretty much everything about UX, email marketing. Design, but our high ticket offer is TikTok. So we wanna focus. I think your skill set around TikTok and finding more clients for that area of work. So I'm just interested to get a little bit of an understanding of how your business model looks and how it works because Like I said, we've taken a few LOs with our previous VAs because they were paying we were paying them monthly retainers They did get us a decent amount of leads. However, when we trawled through them and looked through them in higher detail, the generic account, it's hello emails. It's your info at it's just generic email addresses. So some of them were sending cold emails out for us some of them are just finding those emails and the whole service for shit, to be honest.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: So we're looking forward to getting someone on board that's gonna find high quality leads And I guess when it's just a hundred percent commission, it's in your best interest as well to get us high quality leads, isn't it? So I think it it will work very well.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Can't tell you how many times people have come on these calls and just told me horror stories about VAs. But, yeah, it got a sad. I just wanna ask you some questions just so I can see where you all really wanna be. And to see where I can actually help you, first of all, most importantly. Yeah. Then at the end, I'll explain our service, and you can decide if you wanna be a part of it or not. Is that okay with you? Yeah. Yeah. That's perfect. Cool. So you told me in the LinkedIn message that you had VAs in the past. Could you give a sort of metric on how well they actually did in their outreach?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I guess as a whole, I haven't got a sheet open, but he scraped about a thousand emails and from that, bro, I think we booked about three calls. But like I say, when we when we did a little digging into the metric, So because that was generic accounts. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 2: So\nSpeaker 1: we sort of we couldn't", "doc_id": "d3ce7cb0-2282-4a96-b0db-efef2d5a6f41", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bbe1949a50ff700b12db168e9fad882fcdbd3a860039436bcec446d088963ab7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3802, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8e232b0b-0dcf-441c-84e0-42523bc779c6", "3": "86138d11-6c56-4d9b-a081-cde692e97576"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "86138d11-6c56-4d9b-a081-cde692e97576": {"__data__": {"text": "2: So\nSpeaker 1: we sort of we couldn't micromanage or we didn't we weren't onto it every day. We just thought, okay. We'll let this guy work in parallel with what outreach we're doing in the background. And then we when when we saw, okay, he's got a big list of a thousand leads here. We've booked three calls, why? And it's because there were generic email addresses. Now it's not our cold outreach. We're happy with our we've got a sequence of six emails. So myself and my cofound, we've had business mentors. We've perfected our cold outreach process. And when we send them to personalized emails that we've scraped from LinkedIn, we get like a forty five fifty percent open rate. We book calls. So we know that our our quality and our sequence isn't the issue. So to go back to your original question, answer your question, the metrics, I'd say, yeah, the only way to sort of describe what he delivered was, you know, three calls out of about a thousand emails so shocking.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. That is impressively bad. But Yes. So you sell the TikTok. How much do you charge for this TikTok service?\nSpeaker 1: So the ballpark figures two thousand five hundred GBP for the package. Obviously, we we tweak it and tailor it to each client because Some people are already on TikTok. They understand the power. They just need to get that creative inspiration. You know, they don't have resource to put into the trend research and and identify what post for their niche. Some people wanna be completely hands off and they wanna send us the footage or they wanna shoot content themselves. We have to edit the footage and post it on the app. Ourselves. So we really do tailor it to to the client, but it starts at two thousand five hundred GBP. Okay. So what\nSpeaker 2: does your ideal client look like?\nSpeaker 1: So the ideal client is an an e commerce client that's already got a decent customer base established on another platform. So for example, Instagram. So we tend to when we do our own personal scrape and we tend to look at clients that have got above ten k on Instagram. But don't have a presence on TikTok. So it could be an aesthetically pleasing product you know, the world of e palm, you know, as you know, it could be anything. It could be a new innovative dog toy. It could be we've been working with some skin care brands, but the main thing that we look for is that loud vibrant packaging that we know is gonna be received when on TikTok. Because I don't know if you're on TikTok yourself, but in the first few seconds of the video, People have already decided whether they're gonna continue to watch the video or not, and you need to get a high amount of watch time on your videos in order to do well on the platform. So if you've got vibrant branding, it it just goes hand in hand with when we when we edit the videos and put hooks and call to actions on screen. So when we fund clients with really good branding. We yeah. We tend to handle those.\nSpeaker 2: That sounds good.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So I think I'm about there for you.\nSpeaker 2: So we can come back to it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let's come back to it.\nSpeaker 2: I'll write that down. So what's your actual sales process from stranger to paying customer?\nSpeaker 1: So we've obviously got our sequence of six outreach emails. They never usually get past the third email. We get a response. We jump on a discovery call we talk to the client about well, we ask them why they're not used in TikTok. Most of them say because they think it's an app that primarily attracts children for trending dances and and funny videos. And then we obviously have to we have to sell the platform of TikTok first. So that's why there's there's a very in-depth sales process because as well as selling our services on TikTok. We do that, we have to sell the platform itself. Mhmm.

Mhmm. So we go through the whole the sequence of pitching TikTok, saying there's a billion active monthly users. We do a little bit of research beforehand looking at what our potential clients demographic could be. So we work with the skin care brand, and we did a little bit of research on their target audience. So it was thirty year old women. So obviously, we did a little bit of TikTok to begin. What's the demographic of thirty year old women on the platform? It was like thirty nine percent and that works out for something like two hundred and eighteen million people a month active in in their demographic when you work out how many people are actually on the app. So we just have to sell the platform and we sell our services. And most clients haven't got the resource to actually during what we what we sell to them, which is great. They say that sounds great, but we haven't got the resource to do it, and then we say that's where we can come in. So it's almost like a friendly conversation. To our sales process. It's selling TikTok, telling them how they can use it and how they can capitalize on all of this new traffic. Telling them giving them suggestions. And then when they say that sounds great, we haven't got time. That's where we say, well, we've replicated this for our own e com stores. We've done it clients, we can help you do it as well. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 2: Cool. So do you know you're closing percentage?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I could get it I could get it up. Yeah. My cofounder, Sean's got a big Google Google Doc on me to track everything. The calls you booked, the closing rate. So, yeah, I'll dig that out for you.\nSpeaker 2: An estimate is also fine if you'd like.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I'd like I'd like to find out exactly for you though just to give you the accept\nSpeaker 0: that trick.\nSpeaker 1: It's not updated with the percentage. We've had fifteen calls, landed three clients.\nSpeaker 2: It's about thirty three percent?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Roughly.\nSpeaker 2: Cool. Thanks for that. So now, how are you currently getting customers besides the v VA that you canceled? Anything else, but so we can do that.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So I as well, I've been working alongside the VA. So I do cold outreach every day. So we we use LEMLIST. So myself and my co founder target hundred companies each a day. I scraped the emails using email funded software. We enrolled them into our automated outreach process through specialists, so through the sequence of six emails. So we're actively doing that each day. I'm active on LinkedIn as well, messaging other brand owners. So it's my co founder. So, yeah, we're we're both active daily.\nSpeaker 2: And are you doing, like, custom first lines, all of that?\nSpeaker 1: Custom first lines?\nSpeaker 2: Like personalized personalization for the emails?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Of course. Yeah. Yeah. They're all personalized. Yeah. Tailored to the tell it to the receiver. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 2: Cool. So do you know how we've got a\nSpeaker 1: generic Lumina as well? Oh, really. Recorded a loom video. So it it's a generic high level one that could from a from a customer's perspective, it looks like it could just just to be just to them, but it's very high level just talking about, hey, became a commercial brand. It looks good for our TikTok growth strategy, blah blah blah. So yeah, there's a personalized new new video in the link to the email as well. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Do you know how much it costs you to get a new customer? Or at least\nSpeaker 1: how much it costs? Well, I guess it's it's free to us because the the the clients that we've landed have all been from our own outreach, are they, I guess, they're free to us?\nSpeaker 2: Fair enough.

So\nSpeaker 2: do you have a a system in place that's, you know, actually getting your customers on demand right now?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I guess that's what we we just wanna target more clients on mass. Obviously, we're focusing on client work now. So before And that's why I haven't been able to give you a time metric on how long it's taken us to get clients because we just hammer it every single day, and we used to we've been we've been doing this since. So I think November last year. So it hasn't taken us long. We've perfected the approach. We've landed three clients. And now we wanna focus on client work rather than outreach. So we'll probably just strip back the amount of time that we spend on outreach. So maybe find twenty ideal customers a day each still enroll them into our automated process and then spend the rest of the day smashing up the client work.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. You must be quite busy doing client work and outreach.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a hectic month.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Have been there. So now I just wanna know where you are right now specifically. And where you want to be specifically. So the next question is, how much money are you currently making with this business right now? Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: So it's we've got three clients on a two thousand GBP retainer. So in in six k, obviously, there's only myself and my co founder. So what's up? Our packages start at two thousand five hundred pound, but we're very fortunate that the three clients that we've landed, wanted to shoot content themself. So how our business model looks with these three clients is we essentially do the niche analysis, the trend research. So we dig down into the platform of TikTok for their niche, and then we write scripts for them. So we write scripts capitalizing on their target audience. They shoot the content. They send it to us. We'd store it in a Dropbox location. And then we optimize the content for TikTok, put in the the quarter actions, the text on screen, and just making it look native to the platform to to any TikTok users.\nSpeaker 2: That's cool.\nSpeaker 1: So they're they're all on the same package. Yeah. Two thousand GBP per month.\nSpeaker 2: I mean, twelve months time, where do you wanna be?\nSpeaker 1: We wanna be at ten k. We wanna scale it to ten k. And obviously, I think we could get there. But like I say, when with prioritizing client work, it just gonna take double the amount of time, isn't it? So so we're really eager to get someone on board doing some high quality outreach.\nSpeaker 0: It's what\nSpeaker 1: the end of the year we wanna be making at least ten k.\nSpeaker 2: You don't think if we got client acquisition down, marketing down, You don't think you'd be able to go further than ten k?\nSpeaker 1: For sure. Yeah. For sure. I'll write your optimism. Let's do it.\nSpeaker 2: I only have the optimism because I've seen it. But\nSpeaker 1: yeah. So it's all But some What's your background, Anita? Have you run a agency yourself before? And then you've just dig digressed into outreach? Or\nSpeaker 2: Exactly that. To a degree.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Obviously, I would love to answer all of your questions near the end of the call because I just wanna get through these questions, but I want to listen right now. I sit on an advertising agency. And\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 2: I like the model. But and I found it extremely easy to get clients to get meetings booked. Yep. So I thought it would just be a lot more lucrative to help other agencies to do the same. Which is what I'm doing right now. Yeah. So okay. Yeah. I did also paid advertising, Facebook ads specifically. Mhmm. But\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.", "doc_id": "1bb21557-c131-4cfa-872d-0cf16b8cdb97", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b9999e64eb5421b767d5917c54fe6830e301cb0583510579dd10e5f32fce3e26", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11426, "end": 15204, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8e232b0b-0dcf-441c-84e0-42523bc779c6", "2": "7d631a5b-877c-4c20-baa0-f7423da01500", "3": "0cb8568e-a475-4022-8106-8af8378141b0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "0cb8568e-a475-4022-8106-8af8378141b0": {"__data__": {"text": "paid advertising, Facebook ads specifically.

We'll we'll do that at the end for sure. To go back to your question about why ten k so we're we're running other e commerce stores and drop shipping stores as well. So the agency, it's almost I guess, the agency is our side hustle because the e com stores take a bit of our time as well. So it's just about balancing workload and balancing what what's paying us, whereas if we review it yourself, we're not gonna turn clients down. We're not gonna turn what we've got a business model. We've got a process that we know works. We get resources for the clients. The clients happy. We're happy. You know? So we would never turn work down. But, yeah, I just think it's sensible to aim for ten k. But, yeah, twenty k doesn't seem out of the ocean. Does it either?\nSpeaker 2: Not at all. I'll put down twenty k. So next question. What's your motivation for actually getting to twenty k?\nSpeaker 1: What's the motivation? So one of our e com stores requires a lot more capital to invest in. So we launched a vitamin drink to help with hangover symptoms. And we've we've got a lot of faith in this product, but we've got to really reassess the brand positioning. We've got to spend some money getting the formula developed And we believe we've got some we've got some stakeholders and investors that believe in the product as well. And we know this business model works, we need to spend money on repositioning the brand, and we know that it can be a multi million pound company if we invest time and invest money into paid ads I'm a co founder, Sean, ILS fourteen, Facebook ad expert. Yeah. So we know we've got the model to to scale paid social but we just need to reinvest a load more money into the brand positioning. So I guess a lot of the capital from our agency would go into reinvesting in ourselves Personal courses. Yeah. There's there's so much that we wanna do, especially with our brand and ourselves. So that's the motivation. The snowboard effect. We like to call. That's why our agency called snowball digital because we know that everything does snowball and it's all leveraged against each other. So I guess to answer your question in layman terms, We know that by making more money through our agency, we can ten x our other incomes.\nSpeaker 2: Mhmm. That's good. I like the name too. Like the compound compound effect.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Literally.\nSpeaker 2: So how would the business actually change if you got to twenty k a month?\nSpeaker 1: So we need to invest some money on recipe development, so tweaking our recipe. We'd obviously have more money to play around on with paid ads influencers. So do you want a whole ambassador scheme? We want we want, like, a hundred influencers running an ambassador scheme. There's so much that we want to trial and error. Mhmm. And I think generating more capital through this agency will just allow us to try different things and see what works. That's cool. So I\nSpeaker 2: don't have that many questions left. So I'll just get through the last seven quickly just so I can understand. So you're currently at six k break written pounds, and you want to get to twenty k. What do you think is stopping you from getting there on your own?\nSpeaker 1: Just the mass outreach approach like I say, we really need to focus on client work. And we can't afford to spend our day looking for ideal clients tracking the tracking the open, sending personalized follow ups. So it's just not a great use of our time. We've gotta jump on calls and and brand development meetings for our other recomp stores. So the thing that's slowing us down is is the outreach and the high quality outreach as well. Because any anyone could find a hundred leads. I'm sure I could myself find hundred leads in the next hour and just spam them", "doc_id": "0cb8568e-a475-4022-8106-8af8378141b0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "66ab08ec523a61259297462b7d0215050887920c502c0d71ba873dc6ef5a1abb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15205, "end": 19191, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8e232b0b-0dcf-441c-84e0-42523bc779c6", "2": "1bb21557-c131-4cfa-872d-0cf16b8cdb97", "3": "ee5b0467-df68-4cbf-adfa-ad6b67bf9583"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee5b0467-df68-4cbf-adfa-ad6b67bf9583": {"__data__": {"text": "sure I could myself find hundred leads in the next hour and just spam them with our six deep email outreach, but they're not gonna be high quality leads, and they're probably not gonna convert. So it's it's a little bit more spending time on the research and the the analysis behind it.\nSpeaker 2: Cool. So you're currently at six k. Why not just stay where you are?\nSpeaker 1: So it is a good question. It is a good question, but human nature, I guess. Mhmm. Human nature. No one likes to platter out and remain where they are. And I think in the industry we're in as well. We've always we wanna diversify our portfolio with different brands, see what works for them on TikTok. Because all of the knowledge, it just gets reinvested. So if we work to work with, I don't know, you could do some outreach and find a really cool vitamin drink We take them on board as a client. We post some cool content for those. We do some deep analysis into TikTok. The video for them goes viral or we can replicate the same thing for our own e com stores then. So, yeah, we're just really aware that everything's fully intertwined and we never we never wanna plateau plateau in any area.\nSpeaker 2: I like the answer. I like the ambition. So when do you wanna fix this problem?\nSpeaker 1: Hopefully, he started today, bro. Okay.\nSpeaker 2: Well, Jake, based on what you said, I'm done with the questions. And I have a lot of confidence that I definitely think we can help you. Would you like me to explain a bit more about, you know, what we do? Yeah. Sure. Let's go. So in short, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get more clients by filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agencies we work with are making between four and ten k per month with the goal of getting to around fifteen to thirty k. Typically, these agencies are doing all the outreach, all the service delivery. The owners are doing all of this themselves. And we help them to free up time, take more of an ownership role, and instead of working in the business, help them work on the business by creating reliable and automated client acquisition systems. Mhmm. Would you like some more info?\nSpeaker 1: Yes, please. That sounds good so far, though.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. So first, we'll begin by figuring out your target audience We'll then reconstruct your offer to make it as powerful and attractive to your niche as humanly possible. Next, we'll take this offer and craft a highly resonant message will be used in all your outreach messages. Then we'll place your powerful messaging into highly personalized outreach campaigns that are then sent to prospects that are in huge need of your services. At this time, you can expect meetings to be booked automatically, and the best part is it can be scaled up or down depending on whether you're able to take on new clients or not. So at this point, your marketing will be fully automated, bringing in a consistent flow of, you know, highly qualified meetings. Yep. Do you have any questions?\nSpeaker 1: Take you then. You hear me, bro. You got me, bro? Yeah. Sorry. No. No questions. That that sounds perfect. That sounds good. Deal. It's exactly what we're looking for. And I've got I've got no doubt set when we plug you in. We can start to get our calendar's book to what you say that we love jumping on discovery course of clients. So we had we had a day when when we first launched the agency, we had one week where we had about three calls per day for a week. And that that was when we had most of our calls. And you just get both and you get hyped up So yeah. Yeah. We'd we'd love it if our calendar is full of course. Because we know we can sell them. We get the clients on a course. If they're fit for our for our services. They'd be stupid to tell that's why I really like our business model because we almost make the clients feel like they're stupid to turn down this offer. Yeah. So when we get them on a call, they convert so that", "doc_id": "ee5b0467-df68-4cbf-adfa-ad6b67bf9583", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b91be8439f27992f66a4e782963b127a371706755fcd9965216776dd77ee5582", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19195, "end": 23181, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8e232b0b-0dcf-441c-84e0-42523bc779c6", "2": "0cb8568e-a475-4022-8106-8af8378141b0", "3": "f0ad42db-91f8-4ae7-bbc0-34c8d9f9db12"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f0ad42db-91f8-4ae7-bbc0-34c8d9f9db12": {"__data__": {"text": "down this offer. Yeah. So when we get them on a call, they convert so that sounds brilliant.\nSpeaker 2: Excellent. So the last thing is the pricing as always. Yeah. Would you like me to go into a a detail about that? Yes, please. So as I mentioned, it is pay on result, but there is a setup fee of one thousand dollars from there, you never have to pay us again until you get show ups with highly qualified prospects. And for these appointments, it's simply one hundred dollars per show up. Not per appointment, per show up.\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\nSpeaker 2: Yep. And that is it.\nSpeaker 1: Let's set a fair of a thousand pound, and then it's per bushel. So there's no percentage commission if they convert. No?\nSpeaker 2: No. Folios.\nSpeaker 1: Four hundred dollars. Yeah. Key. And with regards to your outreach process of finding clients, what what process that you use? Do you find personalized emails from LinkedIn? Or do you just scrape, like, use tools like Snuff dot io? Or what's your outreach process like?\nSpeaker 2: We use a combination of many approaches. However, we tend to stay away from I call them software lists where you just yeah. You know what I mean? Because everyone -- Yeah. -- is the same leads. That this\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Few people yeah. Look, we've we've been done the route. We've been using d seven lead finder before. Yeah. Yeah. We would guess we would like this. So many leads on here, but then we step back and forth. We can get them every other agency in the world to probably use them.\nSpeaker 2: Literally. So we use a combination of LinkedIn, Google Search, Facebook, Instagram. Anything we can get.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yep.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. Yeah. So let me tie in with my co founder then because we we've obviously, we can allocate budget to reach out because we know we it's gonna probably come back ten x if we get in our calendar high quality leads. So let me just run this past him. See see his take on it, and then we can get going as soon as, yeah, as soon as Tamara if if he wants to go ahead.\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. If you'd like, we can set up another call with him, and I can answer any questions that he may have if you'd like.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Let me I'll ring you now and then I'll I'll drop you an email or a channel link then and we'll get a second discovery call. Because I'm sure he will have some questions. So, yeah, that'd be odd then.\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. Do you know a specific date? Where you can make\nSpeaker 1: a Wednesday, Wednesday's work. Wednesday's tend to work best. Wednesday afternoon, maybe two PM. So say two PM, Wednesday?\nSpeaker 2: Perfect. I'll send a calendar link and we can talk on LinkedIn about this.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Sure. Okeydoke.

So we are pendulum. So pendulum consulting or we are pendulum. Is basically an e commerce growth agency. So we looking at work with clients who have who owns a DTC brand. Or they have a retail offline store, and they have an e commerce side of things. So we started off working with clients who have predominantly in a retail space, very big brands in Thailand, and they have websites that they need to grow from zero point five percent of total revenue from e commerce to ten percent thirty percent, you know. So we kind of work based on work with those clients first. And then we have a business partner. We're working on those six brands in Thailand, And then we kind of see, like, oh, this is might be something, five business is missing. So we kind of left that side of clients' consultancy and then just kind of side of an agency together. And we're working with D2C brands, still working with D2C brands and some in retail sector, beauty sector to help them grow their e commerce revenue through paid media, email marketing, social media marketing, content marketing, everything.\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic.\nSpeaker 0: And Yeah. So towards the end of last year, we decided Singapore is the next one because we have a lot of clients. We got a few leads, strong leads coming in from Europe, wants to open the market or online. Expand to Asia as well as some Thai brands that want to go to Singapore. So we just registered a company in Singapore and now we kind of reaching out to a lot of people that we know to get to meet people and as well as reaching out to companies like, you know, yourself, to see how we could speed this process up a little bit.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Because it's we only a small team We don't have a business development person because we haven't had the need to have one.

You see, once that are in retail now, they want to expand e commerce as well, majority in the big space. Guys are providing paid media, email, content, social, or with the, you know, with the goal of increasing revenue for\nSpeaker 0: your clients?\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic. And you just open up offices in Singapore and you want to expand there. That's a major goal right now.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yes. As our q two, q three target.\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic. Alright. Cool. So just so that we can put a clear metric on the goal. Let's say twelve months out, where do you guys wanna be?\nSpeaker 0: This is a tricky question even because we are trying to grow here as well. But we couldn't find talent to join the team that would that we see that this is the caliber that we are comfortable handing over a lot of clients work too. It's been a struggle ever since I worked in Thailand, actually. I've been --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- I mean, I've been worked I started my career in in in London and then I went to Singapore and in Hong Kong and then I came to Thailand about nine years ago. To start working with Thailand, Thai clients and Thai colleagues. I find it very, very difficult to find a good digital marketer -- Mhmm. -- to work with me in delivering me delivering the the same performance and the same service level that I require. Because I think I'm not sure if you're aware Thailand is a bit behind in terms of so digital capability compared to London or compared to Singapore. We're maybe ten years behind Singapore and twenty years behind London, I would say. So in terms of talent, it's been very difficult to hire locally. So a lot of the I want to say I wanna grow you know, two, three million dollars revenue. But at the moment, I don't see that I can fulfill those target with the card resource. That we have and the struggle that we have hiring people. Singapore might be a different ballgame because people are more advance in terms of their knowledge, their capability, their more discipline, I would say -- Mhmm. -- and kind of they know how to deliver and take accountability and responsibility. So I feel like it might be different, but we haven't looked yet. So at the moment, by this is partner and I and the small team that we have, with the work that comes in, we will do it ourselves first, and then we will work with freelance and partners to deliver them, especially the technical side, and then we're looking to grow.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So the goal is to get to around two to three million per year, but the biggest limitation is finding the talent that can actually take over you guys.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. Say it. So we just wanna be realistic. So target to target revenue for us for first twelve months at one million, which is about maybe eight hundred u eight hundred thousand USD is probably what we're aiming for.\nSpeaker 1: Eight hundred thousand USD.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's just gonna do the quick calculation.\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Around that.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So out of curiosity, what is the plan in the future to actually start finding the talent?\nSpeaker 0: Well, obviously, we would have to reach the at the moment, the service offerings for Singapore and Thailand. Mhmm. Like, this is Huddl and our small to see the team that we have right now can can deal with\nSpeaker 1: it. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And the way that we the the way that we structure our service offering is", "doc_id": "afd2d11a-6fcd-45f4-a29c-ed4596fa86d2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2c36856314a77a22bcd47ee6ad80752bccd1576940cc15e7ced4ebdf68113abb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3742, "end": 7635, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "d2d198b7-cc4c-4689-933a-0c26eb90fc61", "3": "4d7d4680-0470-4e39-803f-411307551c02"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d7d4680-0470-4e39-803f-411307551c02": {"__data__": {"text": "0: And the way that we the the way that we structure our service offering is to make sure that we, as the management and the core team, can service the client and slowly rolling out to our partners who will be delivering the same the same capability as us, but we will be the client facing it. And then we can if we outsource them and then we come up with, okay, the cost is too high, better to hire in in house, then we didn't do. At the moment, we see that partnering with partners like LTV plus or Uplers seems to be a good fit for us. With the service that we're offering.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. So you'd partner with them that manage the delivery, but you still be client facing.\nSpeaker 0: Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. That's\nSpeaker 0: that's the plan. But obviously, that's based on service offering that we have right now. If that change, for example, clients want us to do, you know, e to e, e commerce, you know, help them launch the brand, run the brand, then it will be a different types of talents that we need.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely.\nSpeaker 0: Which might translate to a in a deep hire.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. That's perfect. So the goal is around eight hundred thousand revenue per year, so around sixty to seventy thousand per month. How far is it from you guys are right now?\nSpeaker 0: We just started.\nSpeaker 1: We just We\nSpeaker 0: just started. We just started. So we kind of we're not taking into account the Thai business because that's kind of just running it on its own. We just need to at the moment, while the plan is to close high business in in in in in altogether because we don't wanna pay for the tax that is so so high, both corporate tax and personal income tax. So we're trying to close that debt, and then we just wanna move to Singapore, my understanding. So we just launched -- Mhmm. -- Incorporated in Singapore in March.\nSpeaker 1: Wow.\nSpeaker 0: So our income is zero at the moment. Although we have one we have one clients who signing us on hopefully soon. He already gave us like a a written confirmation. It's just contract signing. And, hopefully, that kind of, you know, pick it up and and and if you just have to meet more people, The thing is we can do ads. We can do all those cold calling activities, but we kind of that hasn't been working for us for Thailand. So I don't know if it's gonna be working for Singapore. So I'm kind of at the moment looking at different ways to do business development.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. And we're gonna think we'll definitely go into this. We can discuss potentially why it didn't work and what we recommend. And\nSpeaker 0: -- Mhmm. --\nSpeaker 1: that's great. So you just started out in Singapore and for the the Thailand one. The original books. How many clients are you guys working with there right now?\nSpeaker 0: At the moment, we have about One, two, three. About five clients. So we're taking care of their e to e into into any e commerce from building the website all the way to running. We run ads for some of them just ads, and some of them were doing email services.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing.\nSpeaker 0: Set up run. So, yeah, it's the thing is the mistakes that we have for the past year that we run the business in Thailand. Mhmm. We are overestimating the ability of the clients to understand what we do deliver. They know e commerce. But for them, e commerce is having a website and selling it. It's for us, it's more than just that. It's more it's about merchandising. It's about stock management. It's about operation. It's about customer service and it's about tech. So it's everything combined. It's a new discipline on its own. Most high clients that we have, the head of e commerce. Or the person who's taking care of e commerce. Have a sales background? Or have a marketing background?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0:", "doc_id": "4d7d4680-0470-4e39-803f-411307551c02", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "696ddc9905dd3daebea7e3184bd0ef15d679f0bfcefe54de48154c2a575630fb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7645, "end": 11472, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "afd2d11a-6fcd-45f4-a29c-ed4596fa86d2", "3": "3e3d4c70-3104-4854-b34a-fb5a9fbc4543"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "3e3d4c70-3104-4854-b34a-fb5a9fbc4543": {"__data__": {"text": "Or have a marketing background?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Or works have an IT background. Head of ITs. Now taking care of e commerce. So that's that's the struggle that we have for the past years. And they don't really understand what it takes to run, so they don't really see the way we see how e commerce should grow. For them would be, oh, you want the you want more sales? We launch promotion more sales. I'm like, yeah, that's no brainer, but you just you know, you butcher your margin and you destroy the relationship with first purchase. But, you know, you're making them, conditioning them to only expect sales. So it's kind of the way they look at it. It's very different than ours. So it's kind of when we start speaking to clients from Singapore talk talking to business owners Singapore, Malaysia. When I get it, so we kinda wanna move towards that market. Rather than stop here and just, you know, shouting out about our lungs that nobody understands.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So it's really about finding the people that under stand or even just showing them what's missed to actually run an e commerce business. Right? It's not just website and some ads. Ratio is customer service, merchandising, all these.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So it's it's it's it's it's been challenging for us to see to meet clients and speak clients that really understand what it takes. Singapore seems to be a different kettle of fish.\nSpeaker 1: Sure.\nSpeaker 0: So but I have a lot of contacts that I work with in the past in Singapore. Context with software company or agencies or clients, potential clients. But I wanna fish out of that pond.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: A little bit more because as much as I love to go and, you know, ask them to, hey, I can see I kinda see potential from clients who might really need help fixing what's wrong with e commerce.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. And I I love the way you think about it in terms of the business as a whole as opposed to just some ads. Even some of our clients now still look at it and go to just a website and some traffic in there.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. You'll be surprised, like, oh, we have a shop in Shopee in Lazada, marketplace. And now like, yeah, that doesn't mean you run an e commerce though. It's you just you have follow you have to follow them. Like, you won't believe how many times in a month that these marketplaces run promotions -- Yeah. -- and you are conditioned to follow. Otherwise, you can't make sales. And that's just destroy your margin, plus the fee that you have to pay these marketplaces. You've lost twenty percent of the margin just because of that. And because they the people that run business, they run e commerce, they don't take care of the P and L. So they don't know that affected the one million that you get that day, you only make ten percent margin. In comparison to, you know, owning your own audience, looking at from a full funnel perspective, managing your operational well and have a strategy in place. Overall, margin from from online, from e commerce should be the highest one -- Yeah. -- in terms of all your revenue revenue channels. But it's yeah. So anyway, that was a struggle. So it kind of went off track a little bit.\nSpeaker 1: But you're so completely right. And just to get back to it. So we expand to Singapore. Currently, you're just starting out there, which is perfectly fine. Goals to get around sixty, seventy k per month, that's around eight hundred k per year. I guess the only thing stopping you from going from where you are now to the goal is just signing more clients because\nSpeaker 0: -- Exactly. --\nSpeaker 1: you clearly have a better understanding than ninety nine percent of people as to what actually it takes to run an e commerce business. You understand how to do it. Understand how to deliver. You have the team or you're looking for the team and you have the bot you just need to sign more clients.

And in order to sign more clients, you just need to speak to more qualified prospects.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. Exactly. So speak to more people and find the right offering that they would be like, this is what I need. You know, this is my pain point. Great. Let's let's talk. Let's find out more because every time when we have face to face with clients. We get some we get some message across -- Yeah. -- some way somehow. The reason why they don't work for us is because they see us. It's a little bit our price is a little bit more expensive because we not look at it just we do ads for you.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: We we yeah. So a lot of high clients don't understand that because I'm competing with other agencies just for ads alone, competing with agencies that only charge five percent --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- agency fee. Even I cannot do that. And I know that what they did is just setting it up. Click a few buttons and launch it, but that's not how we work.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So but the clients are looking at, oh, it's five versus fifteen. And I'm like, yeah. But the revenue that you generated from us is actually more if you think about. And I have a case that is that prove exactly that. Clients only move from fifteen percent with us. To ten percent with our competitor, and their revenue was gone by thirty thousand USD in first month. I It's I'm like, yeah, I don't have to I don't I don't wanna even go there, but but the the way we do that so we do emails, the way we do content and social. Is very different because we just we're not just for email, we did not just blast.\nSpeaker 1: You\nSpeaker 0: know, we do behavioral studies. We make sure that we send to the right for the right time with the right message. We care about your business. We care about your customer. That's the that's the whole reason why my business partner and I and our team exist because we understand that to make money, it's your customer that you should care about. Not yourself, not your sales, not your margin, it's them. So as soon as you share, you show that They'll know. They appreciate they'll come back without you offering them any promotion. So it's kind of that battle that we have with clients. Always. So they will see us at, oh, you're a little bit more you're too expensive than this person and that person. But then when I get to the fact that that the value that we give you is this. But they were like, yeah. But I only want that. Mhmm. I'm like, I I can't either I can't fight. It's just --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- it's very And it's how you it's it's very heartbreaking. You know, heartbreaking. It's so crushing. When clients go for your competitor, only because they're cheaper. And the worst thing is they won't even know the difference.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: You know, I went back to speak to my clients, the one that chose the other company. Mhmm. And they were and they were like, how how how is your boss respond react with this loss of a million a month because you use different way of the ads targeting. And they were like, they don't care because the off offline is making sales now.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And I'm like, oh my god. It's it's just is like shouting at a wall. So the more people we would like to speak to in the market that understand what it takes and what it's required. Oh, you know what? Maybe I'm just approaching offerings the wrong way this whole time. I never know. You know, so for this year with Singapore talk with Singapore market, my business partner and I'll be kind of streamlined the subs offering. Don't say to people, we are e commerce growth agency. We do everything from agency. That's what we do still.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: But we kind of break it down too.

So you need custom you need to apply customer to make sales and you also have to keep them. These are the ways that we could help you. Are you facing these problems right now talk to us? That's kind of we kind of bring it down to the very, very basic that the business would understand. For Thailand, we just go, how are you sending emails today? Are you just blasting at people? Or are you just sending images, stack up, just one link in one email. Don't do that. So it's kind of we kind of have a have a assess what we've done wrong for the past year and kind of moving towards a new new direction.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Firstly, I just wanna say I love the approach that you take to business on focusing on the customer as a whole instead of what most people do just worry about themselves because you you taking the time and the energy to actually focus on everything else besides, you know, running amazing email campaigns, running amazing ads, you do that already. But all the other things that you focus on as well is one of the it just allows you to stand out because I speak to agency owners literally every single day. And by you saying these things, it genuinely shows that you're providing a ton more value than almost all the other agencies in the similar space. So I think if we can just create your messaging, create your offer in a way that presents all the value that you're already providing.\nSpeaker 0: Then I think he's gonna bring that message across yeah. Getting that message across from me has been a struggle because --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Both. This is fun and myself, both an introvert. And we're not a sound person. We're terrible at it. And it's like, It's like the worst combo. It's not a business. Right? None of us wants to be in front of people and then to say, hey, this is how great we are. Like, we're not bad at all. We kind of stick to like, we know this and we want to deliver this. And if we get in front of the client, people understand the value that we're trying to bring, and it's it's great, you know. But the rest majority of our clients would meet with agency that you've met, and they're just competing on price.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: In fact, be fancy words and fancy presentations. But we have to use twenty people, but I don't have a team. Do any people actually in meetings with you? But I can deliver the word of better of thirty people, you know.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly right. And we have applied extremely extremely similar to you, and I'll send more information about them potentially after this call. His name is Zach. He runs a company called Flax Labs. And again, complete end to end e commerce growth team. So it's not a challenge. Exactly. And even the metric that he goes for isn't even like revenue generated or OS. It's like it's monthly profit because it focuses on everything from operations to merchandising to fulfillment to everything. So I'll talk to you about more about him so that you can pretty much start implementing what he's doing. But just so we know, Obviously, we need to create an offer that allows you to actually present your value. We need to speak to more people on this space. Who actually is your ideal client?\nSpeaker 0: So our ICP's brands well, at the moment, brands in Singapore --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- that is in vertical of retail fashion because we have strong background on retail fashion, beauty, health, and wellness. Home and living. So those space of of clients that we work with in the past. We're targeting, hopefully, well, I don't know. It's it's how difficult it is, but in Thailand, it's been extremely difficult decision makers in the company. So head of e commerce direct e commerce director CEO, CFO, whoever who make decisions. They have to be the brand that willing to grow. We were having, like, the revenue target of those brands as in we would like to work with the brands that makes, you know, five hundred thousand say,", "doc_id": "6dc28c67-da48-4f76-ada0-24aabc234d29", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "d87fcd857f5701960194ae56eb454f7a4a8cdbbb47c952642072b854623f006b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19326, "end": 23377, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "6d547371-a9a5-45e0-9125-9c0d5b93e5bc", "3": "df7ef41a-ddd4-4a09-ade8-f246db1328ec"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "df7ef41a-ddd4-4a09-ade8-f246db1328ec": {"__data__": {"text": "like to work with the brands that makes, you know, five hundred thousand say, per year or something like that in there. But I'm not sure if that's relevant because we are willing to take a brand that doesn't make any money right now to the revenue board that they want if they have the willingness to invest. They have to understand that it to grow busting fuzz, you need to fix whatever is broken. Tech technologically. Technically, in a in a either your website or your funnel or your email campaigns, the technical side of things if it's not working, like, your website load very slow. It's fake version, you know. So -- Yeah. -- they have to understand that there's an audit And there's a first round of fixes set up and foundation that they have to go through with us. And then depends on how big how big job it is. After that, then we'll actually implement the growth services.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's perfect. This is almost exactly what we're doing for a couple of other e commerce agencies now. So talking decision makers, CEO, head of marketing, direct of marketing, e commerce center of fashion, beauty brands, health and wellness, Right? Ideally, making over a five hundred k a year. That's perfectly fine. Will it grow? And you also will it take on brands who may not necessarily have all the money right now, but who are willing to invest in growing the business.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Is that mindset that we're looking for? Or because if they don't have a budget right now, doesn't mean that we can enter with a basic level or, like, a trial level of service --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- fix a lowest hanging fruit for them and they can't take them forward once they can justify the investment with us. So because we that's how we approach a lot of brands from Thailand before because there were how you saw it, Vincent. Like, no, let's let's try with this one because we saw your program. You have a problem with let's say, onboarding and customer acquisition. Let's fix that through conversion rate optimization and proper welcome series. Yeah. And then it's a smaller investment for them and then kind of leads to something that is a bigger bigger fix or bigger implementation along in the for the future.\nSpeaker 1: That's a fantastic approach. So you can get them in at a lower investment one of the lower hanging fruits, you know, sort of fundamentals, welcome flows, make sure the page loads at a certain speed.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Get\nSpeaker 1: them resolved.\nSpeaker 0: If they have the needs to grow, if they have that that that requirement to grow -- Yeah. And willing to just try with the first entry level offer.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Great. Let's all together. Ideally, we would like them to be on either Magento or Shopify or Go commerce platform.\nSpeaker 1: Of course.\nSpeaker 0: If, you know, we we because those are the tech oh, we can work with e commerce, we can work with side cores, ifinity, all those things. But These three are the platforms that we've had a lot of experience in and the tech stack that is around them.\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic. Alright. Cool. So just to recap, before I go through the last things that I wanna ask, Right? Just so that we know we're both on the same page. Right now, you're looking to expand to Singapore. You're just starting out there. The goal is to get around eight hundred thousand dollars per year revenue that's around sixty to seventy thousand per month. The only thing stopping you from getting there is just signing more clients And the only thing we've got to\nSpeaker 0: do for\nSpeaker 1: learning more clients is speaking to enough qualified prospects, which is decision making, retail, beauty, fashion, meet the wellness brands on a daily basis. And if you can do that consistently, I have no doubt in my mind that you'll be able to sign clients just based on the amount of value that you're providing. So if we get you in contact with them, all the way that you can present your value, in a way that's clear, easy to understand, and", "doc_id": "df7ef41a-ddd4-4a09-ade8-f246db1328ec", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "4a288976e0a48cd4715a0f05eadff55af7164a7115e25562c9a7e13c6294486b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 23381, "end": 27407, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "6dc28c67-da48-4f76-ada0-24aabc234d29", "3": "4181f7fb-19df-47aa-8f34-57b00ba9eb7d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4181f7fb-19df-47aa-8f34-57b00ba9eb7d": {"__data__": {"text": "that you can present your value, in a way that's clear, easy to understand, and that the client or the prospect actually understands it. If you can do them consistently every single day, scaling to sixty to seventy k per month will be pretty straight. Would that be good to be close to your situation?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. That sums up perfectly.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. So the last thing that I just wanna figure out before I share, you know, what I recommend is you just walk me through what you what you guys have tried in the past to actually, you know, book meetings, sign clients?\nSpeaker 0: We try come we've tried well, most of the ones that we've tried, we were. We run ads on LinkedIn -- Mhmm. -- and Google. And we've done a campaign. They're still using the ads, but we've launched an ebook for call four seps. To e commerce success. Right? It got a lot of interest, but it doesn't generate any sales leads. I think it's because it was we were targeting Time Market, but the content was an English.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: So that's a mismatch that we kind of foresee. We foresee it, but we did not feel like we should tackle it because we feel like if we wanna work with somebody in Thailand. They should be able to speak English. Mhmm. Because, you know, it's it's just it's not discrimination. It's just it's just that my my business partner is is is British -- Yeah. -- and and because And, honestly, I'm more comfortable speaking in English than in Thai anyway. So if a client will come to us, don't understand a word of English. Yep. And want us to implement, you know, a whole program for them based on our e book.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: I'm stuck doing a loan at the moment. So at the time at the time. So we didn't go for it. I thought even on that, we share it through the digital group within Thailand, and it got a lot of tractions and engagement. A lot of shares -- Yeah. -- but no actual potential business. Coming out of it. We also did a partnership with the United Overseas Bank, which is a bank in Singapore. To do a Fin Lab, which is they incubate a few SMEs. Tools, digital transformation.\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: We also done we have a contact a a time company that do a business development for us, but I don't think they were doing it in the way they didn't they didn't identify ICP. They're basically like, we're gonna target whoever we can for you.\nSpeaker 1: Really?\nSpeaker 0: Then try to book yeah. They basically charged me an x amount to book me up to five meetings a month. But those meetings that those meetings are good brands. Don't get me wrong. They're good brands. But they're not doing e commerce. Again, it's come back like, that they lack understanding of what we do. Mhmm. So they think, oh, a kind that wants social media marketing is e commerce. I'm like, no. That's not e commerce. All the clients that is looking to create an influencer campaign is for us. I'm like, no, that's not for us. Although they have good brands. They're like Bacardi, they're settler, big brands in Thailand as well, but it's not the right product thing. And that's the that's the thing because they think that we are social media and influence the cap agency instead of e commerce is what we do. Even though in my brief sheet. I specifically said that it's an e commerce. Yes. So those are the things that we've tried before. And referral. So we reach out to people that we know who knows people, who knows people, and then those way seems to bring us more business because we get to speak to them. We get to speak to the decision maker because we know a friend of the decision maker or we know somebody in that company or we know somebody in that company. So it's kind of that's the way we manage to get clients Oh, and we were also listed on sort list. It's like a directory --\nSpeaker 1:", "doc_id": "4181f7fb-19df-47aa-8f34-57b00ba9eb7d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "1d67a310eb92812de0e14c6ced568a05d16bbfd2888623431918033fc0af2787", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 27407, "end": 31244, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "df7ef41a-ddd4-4a09-ade8-f246db1328ec", "3": "6367234e-7c42-438f-96cd-71ea2714e1a2"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6367234e-7c42-438f-96cd-71ea2714e1a2": {"__data__": {"text": "and we were also listed on sort list. It's like a directory --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- for agency. That kind of that worked, bring us a few good leads. So this is a directory. I'm sure you'll know of it's from Belgium. Yeah. And they've been very well known in Europe, I think. We listed ourselves a year ago and we got about t something leads coming out of it. We get it says with two business coming out of it. So it's it's pretty good that too. But majority of the leads that come from sort list, the ones that we didn't close, other ones that we couldn't get in touch with them.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Like, they provide email, they provide phone number, but I call and I email nobody replied. So as long as we can get in front of people -- Yeah. -- we have no we have we have no doubt we are confident that we could get in some. We can share our proposal for people that we've met in their happy interest.\nSpeaker 1: I agree differently. So you tried LinkedIn and Google ads, cold calling, the ebook the ebook got attention. It got people to click, it got, you know, interest, but it didn't convert into any sort of sales, then part of this. The entire company doing business development, but they're not reaching out to the right people, and then obviously referrals and sort list. Out of -- Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: all of these besides referrals and sort list, which was the best performing for you guys?\nSpeaker 0: None of them.\nSpeaker 1: None of them.\nSpeaker 0: None of them. Because it wasn't I think it was our approach as well, Ethan. I cannot discredit the platform. Like, all the people who does believe from me. Mhmm. But I think it's just we were lacking we didn't define with them our ICP. We did not we just tell them we want big brands. You know, we want to talk to as many people as we can. We want big brands and we want e commerce or digital. So that's very that very broad relief for them. Can't blame them as well as the creds or the ads that we run were not in a local language --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- as well. So it's not a platform that is not and we are We use a very sophisticated language in comparison to a Thai agency, let's say, run ads. Do SEO. If it's not work, will give you money back. Like, we don't do that kind of ads. Yeah. You know, so I cannot discredit the platform. It's just the app approach maybe not fit for the market. Mhmm. So this year, we scrap all those, learn from our mistakes. And basically starts start start again with a new approach, new partners, you know, new ways. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: That's such a self aware thing to say that it's not the platform's fault. It's just the approach that you took. So many people, if they don't see success, they're like, Yeah. Cold calling definitely doesn't work. You know?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, I I I see it's working, but it's like, Okay. You could get irritated, but it's I think if you do it the right way, you could get to through to people and it\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 0: I think it's just me. Approach is the approach really. It's it's just that it it's an art form in itself and and it takes a lot of courage for me personally, it takes a lot of courage to do to do that, you know. And I I can't do it. I had a conversation with my business partner because we were going through all these traction plans. How are we gonna reach out to people? So we were signing up for business directory for companies contact in Singapore. We also paid for similar web and built with form to, you know, extract out the company information and the platform and the technology that we use to prepare us into speaking that prospects.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And then I'm saying to him, look, I'm gonna tell you right now.", "doc_id": "6367234e-7c42-438f-96cd-71ea2714e1a2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "30a28affba689b760ef808b8d0f38ae4131c32be0a996a6b39221cc0d00e96d1", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 31250, "end": 34991, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "ae1a2c9d-940d-4143-8ca6-f94b95e4646d", "2": "4181f7fb-19df-47aa-8f34-57b00ba9eb7d", "3": "87fd67dd-943b-4195-a40f-637d8a50ec22"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "87fd67dd-943b-4195-a40f-637d8a50ec22": {"__data__": {"text": "And then I'm saying to him, look, I'm gonna tell you right now.

It's condescending over the phone to them.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Like, because my message to them basically say, I know you need us because you can't do it the way we can. We've done it before. We have proven success. You work with us. That's my main message. But I can't say that to them. You're right. Because most of them don't even know what they're doing. Like, I have, like, head off and I'm quote unquote, head of e commerce. For one of the big conglomerate that, like, that sell la carte and selling all these, like, big brands.\nSpeaker 1: Nice.\nSpeaker 0: Positive heading up e commerce It's a merchandising.\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: I'm like, no. And so when I speak to the, she doesn't understand what is e commerce because her e commerce is oh, I select products to go on the website. That's e commerce for me.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And another company who also owns Jimmy Shu in Thailand, for example, distributor. The head of e commerce, quote unquote, is operation. So she deals with logistic, company only. And for her, that is e commerce.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: I can speak to them in their e commerce language.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: But I cannot sell our service to them because they don't understand the whole thing. You know? That's a\nSpeaker 1: good point. Yeah. Because yeah. Then it it could be the case and tell me if the sounds right to me, but it could be the case that all the platforms that work cold calling, Google Ads, email, we just didn't have the right offer the right messaging. Actually comes back to all the value that you have, that\nSpeaker 0: you prefer. Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. And we kind of blocking ourselves because we don't wanna feel We don't wanna sound too cocky. Yeah. The thing is we can't know. Like, if we want to, we can't because we have twenty years of experience. I've I've done e commerce since there's no e commerce in time. I've done email since there's no emails marketing in time, and I've done automation. When Thai people are still blasting email,\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: You know, it's I've done all of that, and I've created the revenues, generated revenues, and own P and L of brands and as of you know, companies before I've done it. I've take the revenue from zero point five percent --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- of total. To five percent and going towards ten percent in two years. Like, I've done it, man. But Nobody gets it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So we don't wanna be cocky because that's not who we are. But we are we kind of brutally honest to people and how you don't like it.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Like they don't like it when you tell when you do tell them your shit.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: It's like, no. But I can take it Singapore and they do it. You should keep doing this. It's alright. Why are you throwing it this way? I've been all that. I've been through it. I'm fine with it, but it's not the way you do it here.\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: So we struggle because the the cultural fit, I would say. Mhmm. I run it because I'm a time. And I've been working in Ireland for a long time, but it's it's just not the way. Yes.

Yes. So, again, it's we need help with business development for Singapore. And in the future, when we're going to Europe, basically.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent And\nSpeaker 0: we don't wanna hire we sometime we don't wanna hire in house even it's just because we wanna be able to put a break when we want to and don't want to have to bear that cause because we know our capacity.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And we work with, let's say, external agency who help us grow with business development. We can tell you this month's pause --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- we can't even more, you know, stop. And and there's a way that we could allocate that portion of budget elsewhere. If we hire an in house business development, we have to pay thing, salary forever, actually, quits, you know? And I don't know if that makes sense. I don't think you make sense. So I'm kind of telling my business partner that I'm looking for alternative now. And he's but he was, like, not sure because he wants to make sure that the clients speak to us --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- because we are the ones that close it. I'm like, it's okay, but the initial bit. The leg work, the running, the calling, the hi. This is Eric calling from it. No. We don't have to do that. I'm changing his spot a little bit, but he's not getting it yet, but but that way.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: What's that?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Very smart approach. And I mean, just to recap everything. I mean, you clearly, clearly have the experience. You clearly have the expertise. Like, twenty years, the results that you have, it's amazing. So we wanna go from pretty much starting out in Singapore to sixty to ten months. And it genuinely seems like the biggest problem you're facing is just acquisition. Right? It's just consistently speaking to qualified prospects who can afford what you're offering that are willing to grow, that have the mindset of growing. And then just putting the right message in front of these people so that you can convert them into clients\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. -- with the problems. And if that's the case, you're like ninety nine percent of our clients who've seen great results. Do you mind if I share what the next steps would be?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. So based on what you told me, like I was saying throughout the call, you'd genuinely seem like a great fit. Right? You are. Clearly amazing at what you do. And to give a quick overview of what we do is that we partner with established marketing agencies you know, ninety five percent of them are in e commerce e commerce growth agencies to increase their revenue by fifty hundred k a month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve across every niche is client acquisition. Right? They start signing enough clients systematically predictably. And the reason is because, one, they may not have the right message to put in front of these people. They're being seen as a a commodity. They're getting, you know, questioned about price. They're being compared to ten thousand agencies. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: They don't\nSpeaker 1: have the right message. Or they're not speaking to enough people. Right? They're not getting this message in front of the right prospects on a daily basis so that they can make the sales. Or commit. So\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. -- based on this, like I said, I definitely think you're a great fit. Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal on exactly how that we can help you reach an extra sixty, seventy k a month based on what you told me to do.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.

So we could do tomorrow at the same time, but an hour earlier. Would that work for you?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. So that would be six thirty for me.\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic. Okay. Cool. So what I'll do is I'll send the invite straight off this call. And we can just confirm if that time is okay for you or don't you, you know, staying up way past your bedtime.\nSpeaker 0: But No. It's my kids who keeps coming in, and I could make me do the math problems. And I'm like, do we see me talking to a person right now? But I can't say no. And when's it gonna go in hiring mode? Yeah. But, yes, eight thirty oh, sorry. Six thirty for me would be great. Yeah. I'm guessing tomorrow you'll be preparing, like, the the fees and everything. Right? I mean, it's just okay. There's some context\nSpeaker 1: between now and then. Either myself or someone else and the team will reach out just confirm everything, make sure that time's okay. And on the call tomorrow, I'll be firstly going through a ton of case studies of e commerce agents, yours, and the one I mentioned earlier, Flex as well, the one that's\nSpeaker 0: yours. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Thank you. And And then I'll be going through our entire process, what I'd recommend for you, so you could genuinely do it with or without us. And then all the details like pricing, how it works, things like that. There again?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's fine. I'm just one question. Do you where are your clients based? Are they based in America or are they based in Europe? Like, which which region?\nSpeaker 1: Great for\nSpeaker 0: Because I'm asking because we're also looking to spend to the UK in Q4.\nSpeaker 1: Yep.\nSpeaker 0: So it depends on how how fast things go. That might be another thing you could help us with as well.\nSpeaker 1: Of course. We so to give some context, we have clients everywhere. Right? So\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Margin is in US, UK. We have a couple in Canada. We have one in Mexico. We have one in Philippines as well. And then some countries like Netherlands, Germany. And they're everywhere. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. But it's a problem because you're working with agencies. Right? I'm just asking us out of curiosity. Will that be like a conflict of interest or like a like because you work with --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- basically, my competitor. How does that work? How does that, you know, what's where is there a line that you draw? Or, like, what? How does that?\nSpeaker 1: That's a great question. And The first line that we draw is if it becomes a case where there's potential conflict We just wanna take the effect in the first place. But\nSpeaker 0: -- Oh, okay. --\nSpeaker 1: it hasn't happened so far. And the reason it is firstly, because e commerce is just a huge space. There are millions of businesses. So the way we go for our talking is very specific. Right? So another company you mentioned earlier, they just went for, like, anyone, any brand, any business that\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Even be close to, you know, useful.

So for example, one of our campaigns for our clients is like I think it was like, what was it? Yeah. Like, coffee brands in Netherlands, making between five hundred k to one point five million.\nSpeaker 0: Very, very specific Okay. I got it. Okay. Again yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. And each client just gets their own little segment as to where we're talking first. So\nSpeaker 0: we'll see.\nSpeaker 1: There's no Okay. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Right. Right. Okay. I'll look forward to the email and speak to you again tomorrow then. I won't keep you any longer. Sorry about the a lot of long winded conversation it tends to get to me. A lot to share.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That is great. And would you want me to invite your partner to this call as well?\nSpeaker 0: No. It's it's it'll be too late for him. So the way he works, if it's if it's if the if everything sounds great, if the investment is is within our within our budget, obviously because we allocate for marketing and business development, then we will proceed. And because I take care of the business development, for both countries right now as in the activities itself. So I have a say in what we're gonna do. I just need to present the hey, say, speak to him through your process. He would have questions, but that could be done through email or another call with him once we are looking to onboard and We can do that later on. Yeah. Basically, that's it.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing.

You might not like what I'm about to\nSpeaker 2: say on this call.\nSpeaker 0: So I have to preface it with that. But the thing that I do wanna speak about is the fact that we just signed up two or three clients was in the last few hours. So pretty much reaching capacity at this point. Right.\nSpeaker 2: There's a few things that I wanna speak about before I present any sort of proposal if we do that. And it's just to make sure that we're actually the best fit for you.\nSpeaker 0: Because the last thing I\nSpeaker 2: want is for, you know, a bad experience for you.

So in terms of your case studies, I know you mentioned that in all your past results, you work with medium sized companies, homebuilders, law firms, publishing companies, coaches, events, planners.

Do you have an idea of what some of those are just as examples?\nSpeaker 1: In regards to which which which part? Like, where does it matter?\nSpeaker 0: No. Pretty much is your best case studies. What were the outcomes that you're able to generate for them?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. I guess you could say it goes anywhere from KPIs from traffic to lead generation to social growth itself. Engagement growth, like all of those aspects as well.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. Cool. So the key metrics that\nSpeaker 2: you track are engagement.\nSpeaker 3: Brokerage. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Broker conversions.\nSpeaker 0: That's a combined that's perfect. Okay. And just out of curiosity, are you able would you have these case studies available, you know, to share?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Of course. We utilize them. That's how we get clients.\nSpeaker 0: K. Cool.\nSpeaker 1: We get clients with proposals. We have content portfolio. In regards to different means and different content brands. And then we have case studies in regards to it, anything from copywriting, blog writing. It's all organized and we shared with clients to get clients.\nSpeaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. Last thing, would you be able to share this with me?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. Are you do you have it on add?\nSpeaker 1: No. I don't have it right now. I'd have to get someone to send it to you.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. Yep. Because, again, I wanna just be fully transparent. We are very near capacity. And this is something weird sales tactic, by the way. So we're actually nearing capacity. And we have room for a few more clients, but we purely wanna base it off of who has the best results that we can actually leverage. Yeah. So because of that, Like I said at the beginning, I think you won't like what I'm saying, but I won't be able to present the proposal today. And it's fine because I just need to evaluate these resources before we take any sort of action on that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That's fine. But I do need some sort of numbers or something to have an under standing prior to even, I guess, booking even another call if you guys decided to work with us. Right? We're we're both taking time here. So I'm just trying to understanding. That's why I'm hearing.\nSpeaker 0:", "doc_id": "a627fe48-baab-46ac-92ca-dadc3adbee9f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "5e8befc4f848606466d299c2df70c244b96f5053bc4227c886b4aebd5d4ed276", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3715, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "3": "6b1bba40-0205-4332-a106-b0dbb92dc0cb"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "6b1bba40-0205-4332-a106-b0dbb92dc0cb": {"__data__": {"text": "just trying to understanding. That's why I'm hearing.\nSpeaker 0: No. I totally understand. And I because we we signed them up very recently. And I hate coming onto the calls, not being able to, you know, provide what we wanted to talk about in the first place. So I totally understand what numbers are you looking for specifically?\nSpeaker 1: In regards to what you guys do, we talked a lot about me, but you didn't talk a lot about you.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Alright. Cool. K. Let me see what I can bring up\nSpeaker 3: in the meantime because, like I said, want you to actually get something out of this. Alright. Cool.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. Okay. You know what? What we can do is I can actually take you through the proposal. Right, that I usually had before this actually happened. And based on that, if you're still interested by\nSpeaker 2: the end of it, what we\nSpeaker 0: can do is you can send over the case studies. I can review it,\nSpeaker 2: and then I can do send the, you know, what an access would be. Would that be okay?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That makes sense.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Perfect. Alright. Because this is what the team wrote up right before this happens. So We added already in the meantime. Alright. Cool. Everything clear? Yeah. Alright. Fantastic. So how to add an extra fifty to a hundred k tier agency within sixty nine months by integrating our client acquisition machine? So what I'm gonna share in this very quick call is, firstly, how to customize your client acquisition and agency growth. The three step system on hundred ad mix for fifty hundred thousand per month without ad spend, problems that may be preventing you from, you know, predictably signing clients and putting sales calls. Our exact system outlines that you could do this with or without us, unique lead generation and client acquisition knowledge found through thousands and thousands of split tests, And then how marketing agents is exactly like yours pretty easily at fifty to a hundred k a month within sixty nine months? What to do first and why? And then a bonus at the end, so stick around. So what I'd like to start with is some quick case studies just so you get an idea of who we've helped in the past. And if you're on YouTube, you might know my good friend, Charlie Morgan. Using scale to two point eight will appear, two hundred and thirty five k a month, using only outreach. Right? And the report mention this. I'm actually speaking at his mastermind in the coming weeks, a good friend of mine. And the reason I mention it is because it shows what's possible using purely outreach. Right? No paid acquisition methods, anything to that degree. And these are the exact same methods that we'd implement for you, for ourselves, and for our other clients. Right? We're also working with Ricky Shea Holdings, Kenny Stevens, areas with Russell Brunson. He's running a eight figure holding company, you know, where he invests in e commerce brands. And he also brought us a growth marketing agency. So he partners with, you know, you know, other brands, other e commerce brands, and he helps him grow through paid acquisition. Also work with Frank. He's building eight figure affiliate marketing systems for e commerce brands. And again, I'll go through this quickly because they want us to be a five up on call. Zach, he's running a multi seven figure e commerce growth agency. We're a Chris seven figure e commerce growth agency. Right? John, again, building seven figure outbound systems from our key agencies. Austin, seven hundred and forty k in the pipeline. And what I really wanna emphasize, because, obviously, the numbers are cool. Anyone can just have some nice numbers. But The key point that I wanna mention is the before and after. Right? What you're gonna see is a recurring pattern. These agency owners, they are firstly great at what they do. Right? Because they're growing from referrals. Their clients love what they're offering. They want to see more of it and they're able to sell and they're able to", "doc_id": "6b1bba40-0205-4332-a106-b0dbb92dc0cb", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "659e471557f5eef2253029c4b06e2c39590c896e7f43e5d5d0d098daff20b4ab", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3660, "end": 7683, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "2": "a627fe48-baab-46ac-92ca-dadc3adbee9f", "3": "84141cb0-023c-4bf6-80c4-b16f40134ec4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "84141cb0-023c-4bf6-80c4-b16f40134ec4": {"__data__": {"text": "They want to see more of it and they're able to sell and they're able to deliver, they just have nobody to sell too. So they tried agents, they tried LinkedIn, they tried email, but not seeing any results from it. So once they start working with us, they're able to add next to twenty four k a month. Two hundred and eighty eight k a year, and he's focused solely on managing his team and, you know, pretty much removed from the operations. Then we've got Geely two hundred and twenty eight k in sales in another thirty days Right? This is sales while training his team. And again, you're seeing the same thing over and over and over. They're growing purely referrals. They're trying to do this themselves. They just wanna get themselves out of the process. And once you do that, two hundred and twenty eight k in under thirty days. Right. Jeff, hundred ninety two k, and again, same thing, same thing, Rasik, all these are marketing agencies focused purely on, you know, conversions, straight ROI, generating sales, generating leads, everything's actually and some of the biggest names in the space as well, keynote, e comm growth, on track, purify all seven figure marketing agencies. Right. So who is this actually for? Because, I mean, at this point, we turned down more agencies than we take on. And it's for established b to b marketing agencies. With existing results and happy clients, like we're saying at the beginning. And agencies who don't have a systematic, predictable method of booking meetings and signing clients who rely on referrals for the growth. And founders and CEOs who have tried email social media outreach by themselves by hiring people working with a legion agency That's still not getting the results that they need. And agencies who have a great service, the systems take on new clients and the ability to sell, but no predictable way of booking the calls with qualified prospects. Right? My founders and CEOs were willing and able to add extra fifty hundred k a month while transitioning from working in the business to working on the business. Right? So, I mean, you can simply add an extra fifty to a hundred k a month by signing more clients. And I know you mentioned your goals to go from forty k to around sixty to a hundred. Which should be pretty straightforward. So what stops most agencies? Right? You can just sign more clients. Why don't we just sign more clients? And it's because They're not speaking to enough qualified prospects every single day. So if we can do this, I mean, scale is inevitable, but there's a problem. Because you as the founder as a CEO, you won't have enough time to do this. Right? Because you're doing everything else. So the only other options you have is one hiring employee that knows high level sales and marketing. But if they know that, they probably have their own business or they cost millions of yen salaries. Or you could hire a legion, you know, agency or freelancer or some guy from Upwork that doesn't really have your best interests at heart. Because they just want to send you some bookings, but you want clients signed. You want revenue generated. You want clients that stay on that you like working. So this is why growth partnering is the only viable option for marketing agencies to really scale because growth partnering combines high level sales and marketing because we do this for ourselves and our clients, plus aligned incentives, meaning we want the same thing. We want you to generate revenue. We want you to sign clients and most importantly, keep the clients for a long, long time. Plus is without costing, you know, millions per year in salaries and we actually guarantee results. So what I'll quickly wanna walk you through are the three steps that I, you know, actually recommend for you to increase your revenue by fifty to a hundred k a month within sixty nine months. And Step one is prepare the vessel, set in the foundations for hyper growth. Step two is launching the machine, the client acquisition system, and step three is the ultimate of conversion, turning interest into revenue. So what I have on the left is the old way of doing things and the old outcome.", "doc_id": "84141cb0-023c-4bf6-80c4-b16f40134ec4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "2663d9c01dc8a3b5e2820c793bb33b547267f030e91847f914826d8822b3079b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7683, "end": 11855, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "2": "6b1bba40-0205-4332-a106-b0dbb92dc0cb", "3": "fa94001f-74cf-4909-9b34-42ffb555302e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "fa94001f-74cf-4909-9b34-42ffb555302e": {"__data__": {"text": "So what I have on the left is the old way of doing things and the old outcome. And on the right, the new way and the new outcome. So The old way is what most agencies do, why they, you know, don't get results and on the right, you know, what we recommend. So the old way is collecting case studies through text. So this is messaging your client, asking what results you get. Put it on to a website, and hope it for the best. But the thing is, anyone can just put numbers on a website. Right? So prospects, they don't relate. They because it can be so easily faked. So you put in all this work with your clients to deliver amazing results, which I know you guys do, just for prospects to not be able to relate. Right? The new way of doing things and what we recommend for all of our clients is case study video or video case study interviews. And what does this is either our team members or your team members gets onto a call with your clients and figures out whether they were before working with you, whether they are after working with you, and what you did to bridge that gap And what you get is a highly, highly engaging and incredibly relatable sales asset that you can use before a call, after a call on your website, on your LinkedIn and it's just gonna solve for you on autopilot. Right? Secondly, is using a commodity offer. So the thing is, The biggest problem for multi agencies is that there are so many, and they all offer such similar services, whether that's you know, branding, marketing, or consulting, or PPC, or SEO. And to the prospect, unfortunately, you just look like everyone else. So because of that, you get no interest. So if you've ever struggled to book meetings, to get attention with Outreach, it's because you just look like everyone else. So the new way of doing things is to build an irresistible offer around what you're already doing, which will allow you to be seen as extremely unique to stand out, to book more meetings, to increase a close percentage, while also raising your prices and increasing the likelihood that prospects will want to stay on board with you. Right? And step three is node profile social proof. So it's the equivalent of looking like everyone else. If you do ARPC from LinkedIn, from your website, for example. And, you know, there's nothing there. It's not established. You're just gonna get no interest, like, you know, having the same offer. So so you're doing a great job on LinkedIn where you're posting content. Correct?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I have someone posting content. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So you you already started on this because you definitely understand the value in this. So you're posting the content, positioning yourself as an expert, which you are. And this will allow you to generate inbound leads, generate high interest, and pre sell prospects before the call. And we can actually leverage any sort of outreach that or any sort of content that you create in the outreach. And that's just if I could force multiply on everything. Right? And step two is obviously relying on referrals in the mind. And as we know, it's unpredictable, it's sporadic, keeps on its anxiety, and it forces you to have to work with anyone that comes to you because, you know, we need cash flow. Right? And it's totally understandable. So the new way is multi account and multi domain LinkedIn and email outreach with a dedicated sales team that will be able to convert replies into bookings. Right? Mhmm. And just to go a bit deeper into this, the reason we do multi account and multi domain is because when we find something that works, when we find something that guess you to sixty k, a hundred k, and you decide, hey, Ethan, this is great, but I wanna go to two hundred. I wanna go to three hundred. I wanna remove myself completely. It's just a matter of doing more of what's already working. Mhmm. We don't have to reinvent the wheel. We don't have to do some crazy TikTok UGC strategy to get your clients. We literally just have to duplicate what's already working, and what that is,", "doc_id": "fa94001f-74cf-4909-9b34-42ffb555302e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "fafbeae8c20b6e1425672eb51da125c661ae996a103fea0756823b3a2a95490b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11852, "end": 15915, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "2": "84141cb0-023c-4bf6-80c4-b16f40134ec4", "3": "cd637378-20e9-4664-956f-7e73474c552d"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "cd637378-20e9-4664-956f-7e73474c552d": {"__data__": {"text": "We literally just have to duplicate what's already working, and what that is, is more domains and more accounts, which will allow you to generate more bookings and more sales. Like we're saying in the last one, it's just the numbers game. So on top of that, we'll provide, you know, we'll hire, manage, train a dedicated sales team that does all this work for you. So they'll manage the replies, get them on to calls with you, and all you need to do is get on the calls and solve them. Right? And I definitely think you'll be able to do that. So and again, the new way the new outcome is systematic, predictable growth, and you choose exactly who you want to work with. Right? You set the qualification criteria. And again, it's incredibly incredibly scalable. And finally step three, this is the conversion system. So the old way, again, is having no brand presence. Right? It's having no website, no LinkedIn profile, no Instagram, nothing. And what it causes a lack of trust, difficulty selling, they don't know who you are. So like you're doing already, a great job with it, is leveraging your brand, your personal brand on LinkedIn, but also the media. That we can get through the video case studies. So prospects can see this before a call, and you're not doing any extra work. But you're selling them because they're watching your stuff. So it boils trust and allows you to sell on autopilot. Secondly, speaking to unqualified prospects, so You know, the worst thing ever is wasting hours towards people aren't even interested in what you do and that don't even know who you are because your time is obviously more valuable than anyone else in the company just out of the fact that you're, you know, the founder. So what we wanna do is pre sell prospects before the calls so that they know who you are. They know what you do. And it'll increase a closed percentage. And then finally, most agency owners, they might be at a hundred k, two hundred k, but they still just have no sales process. Right? And you feel like you're constantly guessing what to say. They just get on to calls. They ask some questions across the fingers and, you know, hope hope they pay. Right? So the new way is to provide a fully optimized sales process based on our eight figure clients that you can just copy and paste into your business. And what we also provide is weekly evaluation, core reviews just to make sure you're closing as many deals as possible. And, you know, the goal is really to turn you into and even better closer than what you are now, just by evaluating your calls, watching them over, and then giving you feedback. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: But\nSpeaker 0: so in summary, this is our system to increase in revenue by fifty to hundred k a month. And at this point, when you have three options, really, you can continue what you're currently doing, not really having a predictable way, you know, to sign clients, to remove yourself from the process, option two, you could work with, I don't know, a lead gen freelancer that doesn't have your best interest at heart. But most likely, unfortunately, won't deliver. And option three, you could partner with us because we've done this so many times, have the high level skills of a farmer k plus employee, and genuinely have your best interest ever. Right? So remember Daniel also launched King Price, all the other cases that he's from before, and the ones that he even mentioned, they started the agencies to help people make money, and they worked so hard to deliver an amazing service, make their clients happy and put the systems in place to grow. But now they had the service, but nobody to sell the service to. So booking meetings and signing clients became the bottleneck. So they tried all these outreach methods, but they still can achieve the predictable growth that they needed. And because they didn't have that predictable growth, they couldn't remove themselves. They couldn't systemize anything. So they didn't have the client acquisition system. We help them to build out a brand new offer, foundational assets, launch the campaigns, pre sell prospects and", "doc_id": "cd637378-20e9-4664-956f-7e73474c552d", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "65beba2a94af1d1ca49e29987d027546eead250645b1e05283f949f7cb87e3e9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15912, "end": 20026, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "2": "fa94001f-74cf-4909-9b34-42ffb555302e", "3": "26625e2a-bd57-4da7-9e99-9587138cee16"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "26625e2a-bd57-4da7-9e99-9587138cee16": {"__data__": {"text": "a brand new offer, foundational assets, launch the campaigns, pre sell prospects and continually improve to be able to add twenty, fifty, one hundred k MOS to the revenue. So now at this point, they're pretty much removed from client acquisition. They have the time to do anything they want to can focus on being a business owner and managing the team's all the business signs clients on autopilot. Right? So one of the last things is some of the outcomes that work with us is that you'll be able predictably booked meetings and signed clients using proven scalable systems. You can pretty comfortably add an extra fifty hundred k mark to your agency within six or nine months. And I know your goal is to go from forty to sixty to a hundred. You know, if we're just looking at that 20k gap, it should be pretty straightforward. Finally stop worrying about when you sign your next client and bring you predictable cash flow. You can forget about working with these nightmare clients and have complete choice of who you want to work with. And you'll just feel calm and confident knowing that the acquisition side of your business will always be taken care of and ran by the numbers. Right? There's no guesswork at all. So the last thing is a quick implementation plan on exactly how long things will take to actually get going, what you can expect, and how everything works. So phase one. Right? And it's the typical time frame is two, three weeks. And, honestly, it will take between ten to fourteen days realistically. But, you know, we'd like to be conservative. But it's usually ten to fourteen days. And what this includes is the entire setup period. Right? Every single thing that we need to do before we launch is done in this small period already. So collecting the case studies, building new offer, optimizing everything, and creating the campaigns. Right? Everything is taken care of here, and it's extremely efficient. And as soon as this is done, we look. Right? So up on campaigns are going on email, on LinkedIn, And again, what this is is just the process of reaching out to prospects, getting them onto your calendar so that all you need to do is sell them. And hypothetically, you know, if messages are going out, bookings can come in. Right? And if bookings are coming in, sales can demand. And finally, the conversion system, and again, this is straight after phase one. So as soon as everything's set up, this is implemented just to make sure you are closing as many deals as humanly possible. And yeah. So I've spent a long time. Hopefully, I wasn't on mute to move. Do you have any questions? No. You're good.\nSpeaker 1: No. That's that's definitely yeah. I was that's good. Right? I'll let you know too. I don't think I ever told Jude. I don't know if you know them scaling with systems, Ravi.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I did his back end. I was doing his back end with his VAs and stuff. I did that even though it's seventeen months, but then it was too much work as me as running my business. I had to depart from there. But I worked with them for quite some time. So I understand all of this. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that's great.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That's good. But what I'm what I'm curious about is, like, what is your implementation in regards to pricing? Right? Yeah. For you guys.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's the good stuff. So obviously, that'll come after in the next three slides. That'll come just wanna make sure everything's clear on the actual process. Is anything unclear at all? Do you have any questions on this?\nSpeaker 1: Not at all. I did see that you you mentioned LinkedIn outbound. Do you guys use, like, a like, is it, like, automated message drip campaigns you guys utilize?\nSpeaker 0: We do, if that's the best option. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Yeah. I've used that for clients as well too, it's very effective.\nSpeaker 0: Nice.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker", "doc_id": "26625e2a-bd57-4da7-9e99-9587138cee16", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8a433f314bd1afedde0f617e7a436848574abc9188d1d50433645f42b182e872", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 20020, "end": 23945, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d66b115b-8c49-4056-8d67-4594effb6ddc", "2": "cd637378-20e9-4664-956f-7e73474c552d", "3": "5480c937-8150-49c7-a3af-3aba43e10141"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "5480c937-8150-49c7-a3af-3aba43e10141": {"__data__": {"text": "very effective.\nSpeaker 0: Nice.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Cool.

That's amazing. So you work for Robbie's team.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah?\nSpeaker 0: Oh, that's\nSpeaker 1: I was yeah, man. Those videos you're seeing on YouTube, man. I had to period all those, man.\nSpeaker 0: Wow. That's it. We\nSpeaker 1: were gonna work with this team in Scottsdale. I did that for quite some time. I think my last episode I did was the one we're there in New York going over Ryan's office. Might have been the last one. But, yeah, I did that for quite some time.\nSpeaker 0: That's amazing. Alright.\nSpeaker 1: It's just really demanding. Right? Like, they're very, very busy. So it's like, I it was demanding of my time. It was like a ten hour day gig. And that's when I was first starting out more not first starting out, but, like, what I was just starting to grow. And then I got to the point where I had to make a decision and what I was doing because the retainer I was with them was wasn't worth it because when I was making more of my business.\nSpeaker 0: That's amazing. Alright. Cool. Yeah. And we can get into the good stuff. So -- Yeah. -- what I'd like to start with is a quick r of our calculator just because the last thing that I want is an emotional decision. And to give some numbers on what we expect, if we were to see fifteen to twenty five bookings a month. Okay? And you've only closed at twenty percent, but the industry average is around thirty percent based on our clients, I know you mentioned in the last call that you are closing at twenty, so I chose to go with that one. Yep. And let's say, we're only charging a three k return. And we recommend all of our clients charge at least, you know, five k, seven k. But, again, we'll go with conservative numbers. So If you were to only close at twenty percent and you only charge three k a month, you would sign on average three to five new clients every single month. But and using ADMAS, you would generate an extra nine to fifteen thousand in additional monthly revenue month on month. Now, obviously, churn is a real thing. But let's just do that for now. So if this was the case, you would generate an extra nine to fifteen thousand every single month. And let's say that happened for nine months. At the end of that period, you would have generated an extra one hundred and eight to one hundred and thirty five thousand dollars in additional monthly revenue at the end of the nine months. But this is an extra one point three to one point six million per year. Right? And the thing is, We're not telling you to close at a hundred and twelve percent. We're not telling you to charge a hundred and ten thousand per month. It's using pretty straightforward math. Right? So that's whenever I say go from forty k to sixty or a hundred is not overly complex or overly difficult. This is why I say that, just because the math is on your side. K? Yeah. So on top of this, on top of the numbers making sense, What we also do is that we guarantee that within six to nine months, we'll reach our revenue target of helping you add an extra fifty thousand to a hundred thousand dollars per month right, in recurrent with you. And if not, myself, my cofounder, your account manager, the sales manager, and all the reps will work completely free until you hit this outcome. So either way, you're not just guaranteed to make your money back. You're not just guaranteed to make an ROI. You're guaranteed to make a huge return on your investment. Because the way we like to think about things is if you're not making ten times what you're paying us at least, then we've done something very very wrong. Right?

Right? So to get into the good stuff, what I have on the left at the top is, you know, if you were to get every single component of our offer, individually from a vendor, from a consultant, from an agency, and the individual costs. So for example, the foundational agency offer creation, niche research, messaging three k, you know, getting case study videos created, edited, formatted every single month, plus the sales assets, two point one per month, and outbound LinkedIn team created and managed two, three, Outbound email team, three thousand eight hundred, end to end sales process creation, you know, optimization every single week, three thousand nine hundred plus two k per month, And then all the software, all the SOPs, all the people templates, and the hiring that we do on behalf of, you know, the company, three point six. And finally, the way we structure the pricing is we have two options. Option one is seven thousand eight hundred for nine months and option two is four thousand nine hundred plus nine percent of the first month retainer of clients that you sign using our services.\nSpeaker 1: So it's only so you have to charge me seventy eight hundred And that's for the complete nine months?\nSpeaker 2: No. It's seventy nine seventy eight hundred for nine months.\nSpeaker 0: Per month?\nSpeaker 3: Per month. Correct.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Makes sense. And then forty nine hundred plus nine percent revenue growth regards to what clients we're bringing in?\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. So it's just the clients that you sign using our services, we just take nine percent off of month to month.\nSpeaker 1: Only one time. Yep. Interesting. Okay. Okay. That sounds too bad.\nSpeaker 0: Glad to hear\nSpeaker 1: that. Sweet? Okay. So I guess I'll get collateral together for you in regards to,\nSpeaker 0: you\nSpeaker 1: know, case studies, like, work we've done. And stuff like that, and you can evaluate it. If you guys have room for what's going on,\nSpeaker 3: that'll be perfect. That'll be perfect. So just wanna make sure. Oh, do you\nSpeaker 0: wanna see the numbers then?\nSpeaker 1: No. You're good. I just\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. And I'll obviously send all the notes to you.\nSpeaker 1: Off as we\nSpeaker 0: yeah. And the deck as well. I just wanna make sure do you have any questions on the process?\nSpeaker 1: No. Like I said, I understand this process and that was why I reached out to you because, like I said, I've I've seen these engines in action. Right? It's just me implementing them and trying to do this right now myself is just not possible. So I do know the potential. Right? Like, I watched Robyn scale from you know what I mean? Yeah. Just under a million a month to two, three, four million, five million, six million, ten million a month. You know what I mean? I know it works. Right? So Okay. Cool. No. I'll get you that stuff. Maybe give me until tomorrow, like, the end of the week, right tomorrow. And then I guess I'll I'll look over again what you share with me. I also have notes here too with my order. I'll go back through and with my team. And then we'll see if you guys feel you guys fit and we could do this or what's going on?\nSpeaker 0: Look, I'll be honest, out of everyone that's I mean, I have a few more calls. I mean, this week. But out of everyone, I'm more confident in you than anyone else that I've been speaking to.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.\nSpeaker 0: Generally -- Okay. -- it's because of I mean, I like you as a person too, but besides that, just based on what you've been saying to of the systems that you have -- Yes. -- based on the way you think the clarity in which you think, having the systems, having the sales process being, like, analytical in terms of knowing the numbers that's required.

I'm I was just gonna honestly, I'll probably send you a Google Drive that you can shift through with a whole bunch of, like, work we've done with clients and stuff. So you can see the quality we do provide. And I mean, like, yeah, it's a lot. There's a lot in there.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. That's perfect.\nSpeaker 1: We just gotta organize it and make it look nice and be able to, you know, and testimonials from my clients. That's easy for me to get, man. Have a really good relationship with at least, like, sixty, seventy percent of them were, you know so I feel I feel like, you know, it makes sense to me. I know you know what I mean in regards to it, that's that's that's investments, you know, in the first few months would be paid back by the time we reach the third. So in in my head so in my head, it makes sense. Right? And it's better than me going and spending, you know what I mean, seven k on ads on Google. And hoping for the best. You know what I mean? So I understand that. And then me even doing something as simple as, like, a link solution and LinkedIn outreach. You know what I mean? Like, I know the cost of all those things, but I also know the cost of managing that stuff. Mhmm. And to make sure it's, you know, it's right. So to be completely hands off, And if there's a turnaround in three months, you know what I mean? Even for me, right, taking that, you know, twenty thousand dollars, putting it aside, and say, okay. Like, we we should be able to at least be breaking even by that second month or getting close to it in regards to that ROI. I think we'd have a clear vision that way. So I I I understand it completely broke.\nSpeaker 2: Absolutely. Yeah. And again, like I said on\nSpeaker 0: the last one, you have this awareness that so many business owners lack.\nSpeaker 1: Right.\nSpeaker 2: That's the person. The way I like to look at it is I mean, if you're charging on a monthly recurring basis, you need what? Two clients?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I think that's what\nSpeaker 1: that's what I mean. Right? So yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Because it's it's not you sign the client and then you have to sign two more. You have to sign two more. It's like you sign the two. And if they stay on, you're literally cash flow positive for the entire period. Yeah. Like, it signed two clients and keep them\nSpeaker 2: on for nine months and you pay for our services and you're making a profit in a entire way. Like\nSpeaker 0: -- Yeah. -- try to structure it\nSpeaker 2: in that way where you can make an ROI extremely simply. Okay. Then based on that, because honestly, all we're looking for is we've helped and the outcomes.\nSpeaker 0: And if the outcomes can be as tailored towards revenue generated or conversions, that'll be the absolute best that we can get. We don't need pictures. We don't need any of this stuff, like, we just need to and if that's the case, I'd be happy\nSpeaker 2: to schedule a follow-up call tomorrow.

Cool. Honestly, I was looking forward to the call. I really wanted to see how we could potentially help you out. So if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you like.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I was talking about it.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Perfect. So other calls usually go very simple. I just wanna start a pause with some quick questions. Help me understand where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially help you get there, Obviously, we've seen, like, good foot. I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works, every other detail, and then we can go from there. Is that cool here?\nSpeaker 1: Sounds good.\nSpeaker 0: Pleasure. Alright. Cool. What made you wanna call schedule the call in the first place?\nSpeaker 1: Well, I'm looking for out sourcing to be able to, you know, filter in more leads and developing a proper system and doing that. We scaled very quickly. So things kinda got out of hand. Right? And not only that, the way we're developing our leads and stuff is kinda like one system that's not necessarily you know, we haven't even really done ads yet. We we funnel through specific platforms. Right? We just started email campaigning and stuff. But, I mean, I just wanna be able to have this together properly, have a working them so that I'm able to follow my lead journey in regards to, you know, potential clients easier to follow-up and be able to integrate specific platforms that would help me do that. And not only that, talk to more people, get more leads in. So I'm trying to scale where I'm trying to go right now, we're around, like, thirty clients. I'm trying to scale to about fifty to a hundred.\nSpeaker 2: Nice.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Amazing. We'll see. Currently, at around thirty clients, the goals get around fifty to a hundred. Yep. Nice. Okay. Cool. So just to summarize everything, the goal right now is to create a system that allows you to get more leads, sign more clients, scale up predictably, systematically, chose for a large follow the lead journey from start to finish. They have clarity on everything. You've also just got an email at the same time. You really just want a system that works to do this. Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Cool. So you wanna go from thirty clients to fifty to a hundred. On average, how much are you charging per client right now?\nSpeaker 1: Right now, I'd say my average is between two thousand monthly USD to above five, six thousand. Cool.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. Two to six k per month. That's amazing. And out of curiosity, why fifty to a hundred? Why that number?\nSpeaker 1: Well, that's my number where I can replace myself. Afford someone to replace myself. Right now, we have about fifteen consultants. We're just bringing on quality control consultant regards to content creation. So we're around, like, sixteen people involved in the team now. So I wanna be able to be in a position to replace myself and be able to have, you know, my team be able to handle, you know, incoming calls, leads, and that's generated without me always having to be in front of the client, and that's gonna be a numbers game.

Because when I started consulting and building my business, I was in front of every single client and I still I mean, with lots of clients weekly, like, I have minimum five, six meetings a day, Monday through Friday, and it's just nonstop. So it's just kinda like we have to scale our our way of getting the clients, getting them in, getting them onboarded, and allowing myself to alleviate that time. Right?\nSpeaker 0: And yeah.\nSpeaker 1: The only way we're gonna do that is with numbers. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah. Numbers are consistency. That's honestly something we hear over and over with the clients who work now. You know, usually, they're the founders. They're the owners. They started everything, but they're doing everything themselves. Yeah. So they're doing sales. But they're also managing the team. But they're also helping the clients, and they're also helping with the accounting. So it's it's just crazy. Think if we can start by systemizing every aspect of the business starting with the acquisition, which is probably the most urgent point now, we can systematically that and it should help to remove you pretty quickly. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Perfect. So just so we get an idea of who you actually wanna speak to because, you know, we wanna speak to them every day, who's your ideal client actually look like?\nSpeaker 1: Well, our ideal client would be, like, a midsized company or start up, right, new business development. Right? I I would say that's what we've been going off after, that's why hence my acquisition cost. Right? Is I mean, what I'm spending what clients are spending monthly is what it is, right, because of where they're at, right, and who we're targeting. So a lot of our clients, you know what I mean, any range from homebuilders to law firms. We have G's. We have node investing companies, publishing companies, We have business coaches. We do their marketing and stuff for event planners, digital assets. So it ranges. We're pretty, like, technical that way with our with our niche. Like, it's hard to narrow it down, but we started collecting, like, emails and scraping and stuff in regards to the majority of clients we had, so about sixty percent of our clients have to do with homebuilding and construction and stuff. So we've kind of found a void in that industry where a lot of these companies lack, you know what I mean, our services and lack that of digital awareness. So I mean, that's a great place to start. We have some geographic areas as well that we've kinda noticed are really easy to kinda slide through and they're you know what I mean? A lack of our our services around. So we have that data and everything like that. It's just now executing and and being able to make that happen. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Hundred percent. That's amazing. Some midsize companies some examples, homebuilders, law firms, publishing companies, coaches, events, planners. You guys are clearly amazing at what you do. Just from the fact you can help all of these different niches, you know -- Yeah. -- doing the same. This so that's amazing. Yeah. Okay. Cool. And if out of curiosity, if you were to pick one Do you have a favorite?\nSpeaker 1: The favorite that I work with, I would have to say, that's a tough one. Yeah. I I I I wouldn't say I necessarily have a favorite man. I I would say in regards to what I feel is cut in cookie dry where we'd be able to get a lot of clients in a systematic form, like, you know, onboarding in in work process. I would say something to do with homebuilding construction, housing, node investing, like, housing stuff. Right? The housing market.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Alright. Cool. That's I\nSpeaker 1: mean, right now, that's the bubble. Right? There's there's inflation. There's there's, you know, interest rates going up. You know, the housing market is gonna turn into a buyer's market here soon for people that are able to do things.

So a lot of people are gonna lean towards that to build their business. So,\nSpeaker 0: yeah, that's a really good point, actually. Yeah. That's perfect. And obviously, you know, if we say mid sized company, it can mean a lot of different things. It can be a pretty, you know, broad statement If you have an idea of what your unideal client would look like, what would that\nSpeaker 1: be? I would say An ideal. I I would probably say a client that's probably has, you know, we're talking numbers wise, I would say anything over, like, a hundred and fifty, two hundred employees.\nSpeaker 0: Do you\nSpeaker 1: know what I mean? Like, once you start getting into that range, you become a number and you're very easily replaceable. And if there's not a touch point anymore, it's kind of more or less, like, if there's it loses the authenticity of you know, feeling our efforts, you know, making a difference for them. Right? Because it's such a large organization. So I mean, like but that's just from my perception of what we've been doing. So I really don't know that other side. Do you know what I mean?\nSpeaker 0: Yep. So, yeah, that's a good point because anything over a hundred two hundred employees. It's just, like, purely transactional. They just see US. It's\nSpeaker 1: purely transactional. Yeah. And on Germany, it's tough and that's those situations. Right? Because the turnover rates are usually pretty quick. They jump agency to agency. You know what I mean? Like, there's no there's no relationship. So why would the the relationship be long? Right?\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. They just if they just see a bad number, then it's over the next one. Right?\nSpeaker 1: Fun.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That's true. Alright. Cool. So just to recap everything, you're currently around thirty clients. And because you're charging around two to six k a month, just to extrapolate that, you add around thirty or sixty to a hundred k a month, that'd be great. Cool. And then No.\nSpeaker 1: Right now right now we're doing around last month, we did around forty something k.\nSpeaker 0: Forty k. That's perfect. And then in terms of goal, obviously, the goal is fifty to hundred clients. Do you have a revenue amount that you're aiming for?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. I I wanna make anywhere between sixty to a hundred thousand a month.\nSpeaker 0: Hundred percent. Honestly, based on our past clients, that's extremely doable. To go from e to sixty to a hundred k? That's the goal? Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Cool. So, I mean, based on that, you wanna go from forty k to sixty to a hundred? Yeah. Do you have things consistently? Yeah. What's this differently?\nSpeaker 1: Because I know this game, this game sometimes in regards to clients the client lifeline usually is like, you know, they start evaluating things or they get what they want within, like, a three to four quarter frame.\nSpeaker 0: So a\nSpeaker 1: lot of clients around that frame start to, you know, shift or they go part time or you know what I mean? Like, sometimes that's when we have interruption. In our monthly income. So I know it's so important having clients consistently coming in. Right?\nSpeaker 0: That's such a good point, and I'm so glad you go that up because this is one of the things that we implement for our clients now in regards to their offer and increasing the LTV of their clients. Because what we found is that if they don't have the right system in place, clients will get what they want and then think, yeah. Okay. I got it now. Let's, you know, stop at this point.\nSpeaker 1: Or I can do it myself\nSpeaker 0: or something. That's the big one.\nSpeaker 2: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So some of the things we implement are systems to make you more the word that we use is", "doc_id": "abb88c56-c89a-4c77-882c-ed7c5c359a8f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02d9a0b20dc6cc37caaf970dd07aad8a1907d9856894c8b8cd834051fe6f3455", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7644, "end": 11445, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b27c478-06d0-484f-8546-0a589c968a74", "2": "f28b6a90-6cb1-4771-8a25-887597a90a46", "3": "9881089d-8e0f-49d9-bd50-21a8fca7e1cf"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9881089d-8e0f-49d9-bd50-21a8fca7e1cf": {"__data__": {"text": "some of the things we implement are systems to make you more the word that we use is sticky to the clients. Yeah. Right? Implementing ways where you are more integrated into their business. And because of this, they kind of need to work with you. And it's in their best interest, of course, because you're, you know, helping them with them all to help them make more money. So -- Yeah. -- if we can also get you in contact with the qualified prospects, but also implement ways so that you keep them for longer. I think it's just gonna add a lot of peace of mind, especially if you're planning on removing yourself from the process? Because the last thing you want after you remove yourself is for clients to start leaving.\nSpeaker 3: Exactly. Right? Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. So, I mean, just to summarize how we spoke about, the goal is to go from forty k to sixty to a hundred k. And the only thing stopping you from getting there is signing more clients consistently. Right? Yeah. You clearly have all the foundations in place already. I mean, to be at the point we are now thirty clients. Your clients clearly love you. You're clearly doing a great job. Right? I don't think you can sell. You probably have all the systems in place already to take on more clients. You probably have results as well. So the only thing stopping you from going from thirty clients to fifty to a hundred is just speaking to more qualified prospects every single day. Yes.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Every that'd be amazing, man. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Like, And I'm not gonna you know, I like to simplify things because a lot of these people that come on the call and say, yeah, you need this paid acquisition method and this weird five step process It's like, it's that's it. So if you wanna get you to forty or from forty to a hundred k, it's really not gonna be a complex process. Mhmm. Because it's not like you're charging twenty dollars per client. It's two to six thousand. So realistically, we only need a couple of clients every single month. And if you just speak to them every days, you know, selling them will be pretty much inevitable. Right?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. It's a numbers game. Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, then. Alright. Yeah. So some of the last things I just wanna figure out is what you're currently doing right now to attract clients. Just so I know anything is an issue right now. So do you mind sharing what you're doing right now?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. So, basically, what we do is I have about four different sales guys, I guess, you per say, Three of them are now sending emails consistently through our listing, through like, trying to qualify our own leads and send emails of just introductory and stuff like that, like copy. And then I have one that utilizes things like Upwork and stuff and goes in contract tools and attracts clients that way and we feed them in. As of now, we're trying to get them when we feed them in, get them off of Upwork, and then get them started on our own basis. And if not, as well, Upwork's been really good to us. Like, we have gotten we've had at least, like, sixty clients, like, come through Upwork, like, in and out, like, that we've had in Lifeline.\nSpeaker 0: Nice. Nice. Yeah. So the main ones right now is email and upload. Correct?\nSpeaker 1: Pretty much.\nSpeaker 3: Perfect. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Alright. Cool. And let's start with the email. How's it working out? How are the results?\nSpeaker 1: We actually just started it, like, two weeks ago because I was like, we need to do more, and that's hence the reason for this call because I understood, you know, we can't put all our eggs in one basket. I need to if I'm gonna really build this out, I need to have leads coming in from, like, five, six different ways. And I wouldn't be able to do it properly. So, like, for me to do it properly,", "doc_id": "9881089d-8e0f-49d9-bd50-21a8fca7e1cf", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "78cc6fb2a8916736aafd93bc61274d7c6585988a0eee167a1f09f03462b960d4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11443, "end": 15274, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b27c478-06d0-484f-8546-0a589c968a74", "2": "abb88c56-c89a-4c77-882c-ed7c5c359a8f", "3": "534d1848-4d17-45c6-bbeb-cb3ecfeecd3f"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "534d1848-4d17-45c6-bbeb-cb3ecfeecd3f": {"__data__": {"text": "to do it properly. So, like, for me to do it properly, can I create those funnels and do specific things myself? Yeah. Probably. But that takes time. And that takes my execution. And that's something I don't have.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly. And like we said, the goal is to move yourself in the first place. So giving us\nSpeaker 3: access. That's just putting\nSpeaker 0: more work.\nSpeaker 1: And I mean, yes, it gives more, but it's more work to do more work, and that's great. It's just and it'd be never and never ending cycle. It'd never stop. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And honestly, the fact that you even mentioned this just shows a level of self awareness that ninety nine percent of people don't have. Because people just don't think this way because they don't realize by you doing the work, Yes. You can get it done. It might it may take for, like, a long time. You can get it done. By the time that you spent doing that, you could have been doing high leverage tasks. Like, hiring\nSpeaker 1: more people. That's what I mean. Right? Like, that's you know, where I can really work on my business and think I have time to think. I just have they don't even have time to do that. I'm doing sixteen hour days for the last two years, man.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, man. Exactly. But yeah. I think you're taking the right steps. Hundred percent, you're definitely taking the right steps. So let's just figure out what the next steps are to actually get this get you out of the actual day today. So -- Yeah. -- you started email right now. Mhmm. Pretty pretty new. Are you looking to implement more systems? Just so I know.\nSpeaker 1: Yes. An effective ones. Right? And and having that you know, whatever platforms we need to like, we'll we'll get sometimes we'll get, like, I would say on average, we're probably signing about two to three new clients a month. Hey. About that, two to three. Mhmm. I usually have about four interviews on average a week. Probably about that. We're our close rates usually, like, twenty percent probably. So every, like,\nSpeaker 0: I\nSpeaker 1: would say every ten we get two contracts, comp interviews. Perfect.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Cool. How many calls would you be able to have with the day? Or would the business be?\nSpeaker 1: You give me twenty. I'll do it.\nSpeaker 3: And I have a team, so we'll do it.\nSpeaker 0: That is perfect.\nSpeaker 3: I need to hire someone to assist the bot. We'll do it. That's what it is.\nSpeaker 0: That is that is what I loved. Yeah. Okay. Cool. So that's email. That's getting you around four opportunities a week.\nSpeaker 1: I would say that mix with Upwork. It's the two right now because we just started email. So a lot of that was Upwork.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, okay. I see. I see. Cool. And obviously, I I hear people using Upwork all the time. How is the actual quality of the people that are coming from Upwork?\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, we have some clients that are only paying a thousand dollars a month. We have a couple. Right? And I mean, like, you run into a lot of, like, stickiness in regards to some newer clients, like, asking too much or too little, you know, or not having the adequate budget. But, I mean, at the same there's still a place for them at the end of the day if I have the hands and the margin. Right? So to make it work, and I think we've kind of figured those margins out in a sense to start being, you know, profitable. Right? Because our overhead isn't super, super high right now, other than, like, platforms we're using consultant fees that I'm, you know, the team And then now, you know, external efforts like administration, being able to accounting, like, organizing our invoices and connecting with clients, like, all that kind of stuff we then that's the time that doesn't really have ROI that", "doc_id": "534d1848-4d17-45c6-bbeb-cb3ecfeecd3f", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "3206ac9b8e851bd74b3b9fd32a2738ac0460620a030cac71e5e95e48decf1951", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15299, "end": 19075, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b27c478-06d0-484f-8546-0a589c968a74", "2": "9881089d-8e0f-49d9-bd50-21a8fca7e1cf", "3": "60d96130-2bd7-4663-b3fa-5c2275326f35"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "60d96130-2bd7-4663-b3fa-5c2275326f35": {"__data__": {"text": "all that kind of stuff we then that's the time that doesn't really have ROI that we're spending. Right?\nSpeaker 0: That's true. That's true. Yeah. Because honestly, to give some context, what we've been seeing with you know, I mean, I speak to agent service every day. A ton of them are using Upwork. And what we find from our book is they can get interest, but it's not the type of interest that they want. So for example, it's people who like, price shopping, so they'll compare ten different agencies at the same time. Like, they just look at you as another number, go with the cheapest one and hope for the best. Or they just\nSpeaker 3: Yeah. Just pay for the best -- Yep.\nSpeaker 0: -- pretty much. Like -- Yeah. -- you could be delivering a service ten times better than everyone else but they'll see this guy oh, he's from Philippines. He can do it for twenty bucks. Okay. This is Thursday.\nSpeaker 1: Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: Like yeah. That's generally what happens. So the same in the same way, you'll get the best hires or the best hires you're not gonna get. You know, they're not just gonna sign up to work with every company. You're gonna have to go out and find them from other place. That's pretty much the same way we found to get the best clients. But, yeah, proactively reach out to them. So, I mean, that's both if you're getting around four opportunities per week with Outlook and email. And are you doing anything else?\nSpeaker 1: That's that's honestly it right now. The rest of all the efforts are into the actual finishing, you know, the tasks and the work and being able to you know, get the clients work done. Like, that's where we've kind of gotten to. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Okay. Honestly, I think I honestly think you're in a great situation right now. In terms of having the foundations to scale up. Right? So to summarize everything, it seems like, obviously, the goal is to go from a forty k to sixty to a hundred. Right? The only thing stopping from getting there is signing more clients. The only thing stopping from signing more clients is speaking to enough, high quality, you know, prospects that afford what you're offering or can afford what you're offering, that one but you're offering, and speaking to them every single day. And at that point, you say it's a numbers game. Right? You close the numbers game. You know your numbers. You can just get enough. You close them again. You'll hit the goal and you have to click. So if we can just solve that one problem, then, I mean, it should be pretty straightforward. So if that's the case and you're like, I'm ninety nine percent of our clients have seen great results. Do you mind if I share what the next step would be?\nSpeaker 1: Yes. Let's do it. What time is it? We still got lots of time. We're booked until sorry. One sec even.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, good. And it should've take, like, two minutes anyways.\nSpeaker 2: Yep. I just wanna make sure I don't know. Not rush here.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. I'm yeah. I'm good for another forty five minutes.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Cool. Yeah. I've I will then come, like, forty five minutes. I actually have to run another call in five. But there\nSpeaker 1: you go. Okay. Then you're on the same page.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I do have to do a quick overview is that we help establish marketing agencies to increase revenue by fifty to one hundred k a month within around sixty nine months. And like we're speaking about the entire goal, the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition, right, across the board, across industries, across everything is just being able to get in contact with enough qualified prospects every single day. And if they can do that, scale is genuinely inevitable. Right? Because like you're saying, it is a numbers game. So getting from forty to a hundred k, should not be complex. It's just a matter of", "doc_id": "60d96130-2bd7-4663-b3fa-5c2275326f35", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7fee3fac91a307cbbb8806a7e6922cb4c8f39027f725306a8b09a65b300af605", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 19054, "end": 22923, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "8b27c478-06d0-484f-8546-0a589c968a74", "2": "534d1848-4d17-45c6-bbeb-cb3ecfeecd3f", "3": "b259907e-c601-4784-bee2-a906ff27d2ea"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b259907e-c601-4784-bee2-a906ff27d2ea": {"__data__": {"text": "from forty to a hundred k, should not be complex.

Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up poll where I can create a customized proposal and share exactly how I think we can help you reach hundred k a month based on what you told me today?\nSpeaker 1: Of course. Is it possible for us to do that tonight or tomorrow?\nSpeaker 0: Tomorrow? I\nSpeaker 3: don't quit, man.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Tomorrow Oh, tomorrow's Thursday. Is that even possible for you?\nSpeaker 0: Well, we move past tomorrow's symptom.\nSpeaker 2: Tomorrow's saying, oh, what times are we now? World traffic?\nSpeaker 1: Let's do it. Come in.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, man. You know, you are the first person. Who suggested doing it tomorrow. I I'm always the first one to suggest doing it tomorrow. But everyone was like, yeah. Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah, man. It's I I know time was of the essence, man, and I and I'm eager to get this done, like, in a sense of setting up these systems. And not only that, I have one question for you, so your\nSpeaker 2: team, before you go,\nSpeaker 0: that you do\nSpeaker 1: you guys help with action? Actual execution of setting up specific integration or, like, whatever we need to, like, you know, form the actual leads and stuff. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. Do you mind just going a bit more in detail so I can be sure?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So, like, us being able to have, like, something specific like a program, not necessarily, like, Salesforce or anything. But, like, something that allowed us to be able to, you know, a CRM for us to have and track our our our our leads coming in and we see them coming in, integrated to our calendars, all that kind of stuff.\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. It's completely integrated, and I'll be honest, one of our major objectives is for you to work as little as possible in the process. So the music's my responsibility. So a hundred percent, we set up the CRM completely from start finish. Assuming you don't have already, we cover everything. So CRM, you'll have all the lead details. You can just see them go throughout the process in the pipeline. We'll have all the details that'll be booked straight into a calendar. All you have to do is get on to calls and solve them.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. And question,\nSpeaker 0: did you\nSpeaker 1: guys assist with any specific integration, like, in regards to, like, onboarding. So, like, trip campaigns or something when we have you can have people in, like, immediately from those leads or anything like that?\nSpeaker 0: In terms of prospects onboarding?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Pro prospects, I guess, per se, You know, I'm following that following up with them and stuff, like a drip campaign and all that kind of stuff?\nSpeaker 0: Absolutely. So We actually have two components for the follow ups. The first is group campaigns like you mentioned, but we also got a step further. And and again, this is what I'll mention in the actual proposal. As we provide so we hire manage and train a dedicated sales team that'll work for your company and, obviously, managed by us. And they'll follow-up manually as well calling them, emailing them, making sure they get onto the call are preowned.\nSpeaker 1: And Amazing. Yeah. Okay. Okay? No amazing.

It's only an hour ahead of ten o'clock.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, if you might be wondering about the no video thing. I usually do this. It just allows people to focus more on what's being said than checking their hair and stuff. But by all means, you wanna keep yours on? No problem.\nSpeaker 1: Sure. I can just trim it off.

Cool. Cool. So, Nick, tell me what motivated you to take this quarter?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Good question. It's just because I have been well, I guess, I could tell you the whole spiel. Basically, yeah, I've had my company for I've been working on a full time for, like, eight months or something like that. Nothing too crazy. I've done everything has been done by myself. Sales. I don't get a service delivery. I have people that work for me that does the actual service delivery for my clients. But the whole sourcing and, you know, reaching other companies closing closing new new clients. Everything is done by me. And, basically, I'm always hoping to hearing a little bit about how so I can help me do that. So I have to do everything by myself. The whole part that I hate is, you know, the the cold outreach. I'm right around there just I'd love, you know, having an initial meeting with clients and you know, closing, obviously. But I just don't have time to continue to feed my company right now because I've so focused on other stuff as well. A part owner and other company. So I'm kinda stuck between, you know, not having enough time to do outreach myself, but I still want new clients. Basically.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. Perfect. Am I right in saying that you offer paid advertising?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. The the paid advertising, Facebook ads, take the ads, snap ten ads, and it's all to e commerce businesses or or apps, actually.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. And how do you price your services?\nSpeaker 1: At the moment, it's either just, like, a month either just a monthly retainer or a monthly retainer plus. A percentage of ad profits or of ad spend.\nSpeaker 0: That's cool. On average, what's the value of the retainer?\nSpeaker 1: On average, that's a good question. It's very different. I would say on average, probably, like, twelve hundred with US. Well, it's very different. I have some paying. Twenty two hundred. I have one paying nine thousand. I have one paying. It's different.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's a large variable. Cool. So who is your actual ideal customer?\nSpeaker 1: It is e commerce businesses.

Exactly.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And any specific niche that you work with?\nSpeaker 1: Clothing, I would say, men's and women's clothing. And that's probably where most of my my my clients are are from men's women's clothing and just fashion in general. I don't know. It's a bit broader, but yeah.\nSpeaker 0: And can you tell me about your sales process?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. So my sales process, basically, at the moment, is I do like I said, I do everything my outreach comes either from LinkedIn or people come to me. You just recommendations or or Upwork, different stuff like that, really. And then, usually, what I usually what I do is I yeah. Hop on a quick meeting with them, doing exactly what we're doing now, ask a bunch of discovery questions, get to know the business a bit, and then it's usually just a one call sometimes too cold, but you can tell pretty quick if someone's interested or not. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. Sounds good. Do you know your closing percentage?\nSpeaker 1: I would say, like, if I have if I book meetings with people and actually, you know, they up the meeting. In the interset, I closed probably one out of three. Well, I don't have enough meetings.\nSpeaker 0: I see. Yeah. So besides LinkedIn and clients coming to you, how do you come to get customers?\nSpeaker 1: How I how I contact them?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. What's your outreach methods?\nSpeaker 1: Like I said, there's Upwork. I'm not sure if you're familiar with Upwork. Like I said, that's a website, basically, through there, applying their bunch of jobs to there. And that's basically it. Like, I don't have much more than that. I I did do I've I've done a lot of cold calling in my days, but I haven't done that for a while. Just because I hate her so much.\nSpeaker 0: I get there all the time for her.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Cool.

Some days\nSpeaker 0: -- Yeah. --\nSpeaker 1: when I have time, I do outreach. Other days, I don't. And then it's it's, like, it it's all over the place. Need structure.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So now I just wanna understand exactly where you are and exactly where you where you wanna be with a metric. So much money are you currently making per month for this business?\nSpeaker 1: This month, I'm gonna make I'm not sure if you speak US dollars, but I'm just gonna give you\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: You're gonna make this month. I'm gonna make let me just do the conversion here. This month, we're gonna probably make around fifteen thousand US dollars\nSpeaker 0: Cool.

You're currently making fifteen thousand. You wanna get to around forty to fifty k. What do you think stopping you from getting there?\nSpeaker 1: Time people and not being yeah. Not enough processes. And I've only been going for eight months, so I've learned to shit time in the last bit. Basically, having the time to do outreach, having a constant flow of meetings, and having processes in place with with my with my cold outreach and management of time, basically. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Perfect. So currently at fifteen k, by a lot of people's measures. That's pretty good. Why not just how we were?\nSpeaker 1: I don't really I don't know. Like, I just I don't I don't know why I'll just say why I'm inside. I know I I know I can do a lot better. I know I know how to sell. I know how to sell our services and how to talk to people. So I don't see any reason why I can't push this to being a long word in that.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. And when are you looking to solve this problem?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. ASAP. Exactly what you want to hear probably.\nSpeaker 0: Well, based on your answers, I have a lot of confidence that I can definitely help you with this. Would you like me to explain a bit more about what we do?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. I'm pretty curious to hear what you do and how you do it.\nSpeaker 0: Excellent. So in short, our area of expertise is helping agencies to get more clients by automating their client acquisition and filling their calendars with highly qualified leads. Typically, the agencies that we work with are making between ten and thirty thousand dollars per month with the goal of getting to around forty to sixty thousand dollars per month. Typically, these owners are doing everything in the business themselves from sales to outreach, and they're just lacking a lot of time. They're also lacking systems to get clients, you know, on autopilot when they want. So we help them to automate and customize a client acquisition and to take more of an ownership role in their business. We have them to move from working in the business to working on the business. So in conclusion based on what you said, it seems like you're a phenomenal fit for what we do.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. For sure. How do you guys do it though? Like, what's your processes when it comes to? Know, feeling every calendar is that kind of thing. Like, what do you guys in this process? Is who does it? How do you do it? Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: So Yeah. I'll I'll just give a a full overview of the entire process. Is that alright with you?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Cool for it.\nSpeaker 0: Cool. So to start, our service was created with one goal in mind to help you to get more clients by providing a constant stream of new meetings with prospects in huge needed services. So we'll start by creating a new offer and designing unique messaging that will stand out from all the other agencies and attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you. Then we'll utilize", "doc_id": "44c0bdfd-e336-4755-a845-969f454d6d04", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7b315c39e2cb19c0f0803e227a3fbf100abd19e196a0672af0d93b59fe0bebbc", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7301, "end": 11162, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4e2ca4ef-f787-4dbe-b858-67596b33a2a0", "2": "273f0c16-dbde-4b6b-baae-4dabcea767dd", "3": "65942fb2-2b90-4f1e-8e26-e736273aa1d7"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "65942fb2-2b90-4f1e-8e26-e736273aa1d7": {"__data__": {"text": "and attract your ideal clients to book meetings with you.

In addition to this, the entire process start to finishes one hundred percent done for you, meaning you literally just have to show up the calls with prospects in huge need of your services. And solve them on that. So the entire service was designed for owners looking to breakthrough automated outreach and get to around forty to sixty thousand dollars per month. Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. That does sounds great. Like so you mentioned on LinkedIn, obviously, you pay for results, that kind of thing, which is great. When it comes to your like, does it is it, like, you know, you do cold calling and email outreach or what, like, works best for you for you? Or do you have a team or what?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We have a team and our methods include cold email and LinkedIn outreach.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Got it. And is that done through, like, through my LinkedIn profile? Or how does that work?\nSpeaker 0: For the email, we'll create a separate one. This just keeps this just helps to keep everything organized and to protect your email from potentially anything. And in addition to this, we would use your LinkedIn account.\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Got it. Okay. That's fine. Cool. And that's awesome. And that what like, I I assume you've worked with, you know, other marketing agencies. Right?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. All of them are marketing entities.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Okay. And and, like, what's your experience with, like, e commerce businesses and stuff like that? Like, are they pretty easy I could reach out to?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. I don't know if I've mentioned this, but all the clients who we work with target e com brands.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. I know. You definitely did mention that, but that's great. Cool. And, like, how does it work? Like, obviously, you actually pay for, like, for results. What's, like, the what's the rates? How does it work with charging? And yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Yes. I'll just give the entire pricing overview. Is that okay with you? Yeah. Sure. Sure. Aphi for building and managing this entire system is a one time setup we have three thousand dollars. And from there, it's only one hundred dollars per appointment. But What we found after doing this for a lot of agencies and for very long time is that the people make decisions quickly always turn out to the best clients and we get them the best results because of that. So for those reasons, we have something called incentive based pricing where if you can make the decision today, I'll cut the setup in half and then it's just a one time setup of one thousand five hundred dollars and one hundred dollars per qualified appointment.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. And what does that setup fee include? Like, what setup like, how does that work?\nSpeaker 0: So there's a couple of things that it goes into. One is the team members, obviously. The people managing your account, the people sourcing the leads. Then it's for every account that we have additional software costs incurred because of that So it'll mostly go to sourcing a leads, setting up the entire systems where we'll send emails from, warming up your account, things like that.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. Cool. And how often or, like, how long does it usually take for you to, you know, see results?\nSpeaker 0: Sure. So in I'm not sure if you saw on the LinkedIn, but we say we guarantee fifteen to thirty five meetings per month. To get up to that point, It takes usually, it takes around sixty to ninety days to scale up the outreach to that point.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: However, that's not to say you're not gonna see results in the first month. It just won't be that level from the start. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No.", "doc_id": "65942fb2-2b90-4f1e-8e26-e736273aa1d7", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0ba5265f5a5f257361edde8c74ce546c5592789475263fb01c9b1eae970e7ec7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11138, "end": 15086, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "4e2ca4ef-f787-4dbe-b858-67596b33a2a0", "2": "44c0bdfd-e336-4755-a845-969f454d6d04", "3": "f2e0034b-c3ce-4a30-9998-e31a8511c703"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f2e0034b-c3ce-4a30-9998-e31a8511c703": {"__data__": {"text": "won't be that level from the start. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. No. That's fine. And how does it work? Like, how does it get a meeting with someone that's amazing? Like, what if let's say the person who doesn't show up to the meeting, he can't get in touch I go. I'm still entitled to pay for a meeting like that or how does that work?\nSpeaker 0: No. I wouldn't. We would never charge for someone that doesn't show up. Don't think that's fair.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. So what do I like, what's, like, considered, like, a qualified meeting in your eyes then? So But no.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. When we get set up, I'm gonna ask you your criteria on the leads you're looking for exactly. Who want us to target. And based on those numbers, we'll set up some parameters to determine the qualification process. For example, monthly revenue. It's a common one we've used. Social media following another one. So based on those criteria, and if they show up, that would would determine whether it's qualified or not.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Okay. That makes sense. Cool. Like, that sounds pretty safe to be honest. No. That's cool. I'm I'm definitely down. What I can do is have a meeting with my calendar in in ten minutes. But what I can do is how does it work to get started? Like, if you pay everything upfront or, like, can you split it up? Or how does it work?\nSpeaker 0: Most of them are paid upfront. However, if you need it, we can split up the payment into two months of the settlement. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So, like, you you do have and then yeah. Okay. That makes good sense. Cool. That sounds great. Let me cool. Well, I'm definitely down for this. This seems pretty cool. I guess the only thing that I wanna ask is, like, do you send notes, like, an agreement or, like, how does it work?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. After the payment is made, I'll send you the onboarding link that will get you into the Slack. And then from there, I'll send you a fully written out contract that we'll talk about, discuss. Yeah. Everything will be in Okay. Yeah. Everything will be affected.\nSpeaker 1: Should I do? Should I do the contract before payment though?\nSpeaker 0: We typically don't do it that way, but if if it's needed. Yeah. Worst case scenario\nSpeaker 1: That'd be great.\nSpeaker 0: If we if we don't agree, on something in the contract, we could always refund you. It's never happened before, but, I mean, it's a possibility. Because it takes it takes us to write out the contract for every person. So we don't like the delay on getting started. Because if you pay now, then we can get you onboarding everything in a lot faster time than waiting for the contract, if you know what I mean.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Is there, like, a is there, like, a binding period?\nSpeaker 0: What do you mean by that?\nSpeaker 1: Like, is my like, if we were to work together, is it, like, you know, we're, like, blinded, like, on the contract for, like, a couple months? Or, like, is it just month to month? Or out of the work?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's month on month. There's no official binding. However we go for could you explain what you mean specifically?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Like, I just mean, like, if I sign a new client, it's like I'd say, like, the period is for a minimum of three months. You can't cancel before three months kind of thing. Is that the same for you? Or how do you do it?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. We do it usually. If no results are seen and the client wants to cancel, we do three months of minimum outreach, the ninety days that we talk about. Yeah. It's in the contract, but it's never happened before. So I can't really give a good answer. But, yeah, we go for just ninety days.\nSpeaker 1: Okay.

Is Gina the correct pronunciation?\nSpeaker 0: It is. Yeah. Just spelled with two m's. Yeah. It's spelled different.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Fair enough. Alright. Cool, Gina. I was looking forward to the call. Really wanted to see how we could potentially help you out. So if you're open to it, I can get us started with the whole process if you'd like.\nSpeaker 0: Well, why don't you tell me more about it? I've I've had just a little bit of time to go through your YouTube videos. Because today's I almost had to reschedule, but I didn't want to. So so why don't you tell me what you offer? Yeah. And yeah. And then we can talk about going from there.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. So to give a quick overview as to what we do, not I'll just assume you haven't been able to look at any of the stuff is that we help establish marketing agencies typically increase revenue by fifty to one hundred k per month within around sixty nine And the absolute biggest problem that we help to solve is client acquisition. Right? So I speak to agency owners every single day and the most common thing that I hear and the most common thing, you know, that they struggle with is just predictably acquiring clients. And usually, they have all the foundations in place already. Meaning they know how to deliver. They have happy clients, they have case studies, they have false results, they have everything there, team member systems, they're just not able to sign clients predictably. And usually the biggest thing stopping it from doing this is, you know, getting in contact with their audio prospects. So once they to speak to their ideal prospects every single day, you know, sales making sales signing clients becomes pretty much inevitable. And that's really what I wanted to discuss on this call. And how they usually go is just wanna start off with all sorts of quick questions, help me understand, you know, where you are, where you wanna be, and if we could potentially help you get there. Obviously, if you see good fit, I'll walk you through the entire offer, how it works, and a lot more detail on this. And then go from there. Is that okay?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. Yep. Perfect.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Alright. Cool. So Gina, what made you wanna take the call in the first place?\nSpeaker 0: Those struggles that you're talking about primarily. So A lot of okay. So there's two sides to my business, my agency, which has been around since two thousand nine, all pretty much referral based.\nSpeaker 1: Really?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And then over the last five years or so, I also do coaching and mentoring ships. So I have a couple mastermind programs that I run. So because I've built my teams, they were a team of ten to twelve just depends on our projects. It's given me more time to focus on my mastermind client. With that said, I still have the agency and I still wanna continue to grow that. So my focus is so heavily me personally. My focus has been so heavily on bringing in more clients into my mastermind. And you know what? One second. My Zoom just I have an issue with my Zoom that it blocks out for a second, and I need to switch from my phone and back to my laptop. I don't", "doc_id": "d2bd115a-2343-4af7-856c-956e792ed5dc", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f0bf3762a76eec5928e729e90d85548e8a1841fa6bda8bf2d81cde4adab46fe2", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 3802, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96620b77-5138-4a95-9e7f-44be8ede378e", "3": "932ffdd6-516e-4324-99dc-c51c0c3527aa"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "932ffdd6-516e-4324-99dc-c51c0c3527aa": {"__data__": {"text": "second, and I need to switch from my phone and back to my laptop. I don't know why. So you can probably see me, but I can't see you. Hold on one second. I'm gonna do a quick quick switch. But I can keep talking. So, basically, as an agency, I would say that we're roughly we average between forty to sixty thousand a month in revenue. And that's, you know, consistent revenue. But I obviously would like to grow that to to grow that to a hundred k mux. Right? And so I personally don't have the time to be finding leads. I do have somebody on my team. I have an assistant. She's been doing a lot inside of LinkedIn and funneling people into Apollo. And so that just literally started, like, two weeks ago. But it's still there's still a lot of, like, things that I need to do, right, to get it set up and get going. So I really am looking and I have been thinking about bringing on, like, a salesperson, something like that. So I've been looking for something similar to what you offer. So, yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.\nSpeaker 1: That's great. That's great. So just so I know I heard everything correctly, currently you're running the agency, but you also have a coaching and, you know, an entire mastermind. The agency is doing forty thousand and sixty thousand per month. You have a team around ten to twelve people. That's great. And great body is that your agency is growing almost purely on referrals. Which just indicates that when your clients love you very much and they're referring to other people.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And our clients typically and you know what I can Oh, I didn't switch. Our clients typically are with us for at least four or five years.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing.\nSpeaker 0: And we only you know, I will only take on a certain amount of planes and certain who I take on as a client. So can you hear me okay?\nSpeaker 1: Just a bit quiet.\nSpeaker 0: How about now? Hold on. Let me I'm sorry. I'm having all these technical issues right now. It's probably because I switched. So let me check my audio settings. Okay. How about now? Am I good? Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: It's better. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Okay. So, yeah, our clients are, you know, pretty long term. My retainers are a minimum of a year. Like, know, it's an annual contract to work with us. Usually, sometimes they make some, you know, depends on depends on what we have going on. Like, if I'm like, okay. Look, I really wanna work with them. I'll I'll do a six month contract. But yeah. So our clients are they're long term clients. And so, yeah, that's why we get a lot of referrals. And I don't always take on new clients. Like, right now, I'm in the position I have two proposals out for two more agency clients. As we bring on more clients, I'm ready to hire more. Too. So that's I'm always open to hiring more and growing and expanding that way.\nSpeaker 1: Got it. That's amazing. So is the reason for not, you know, hiring more people because of the limitation in terms of predicting on clients if you have to bring on clients to buy more people?\nSpeaker 0: Right. Got it.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. That's amazing. So you add around forty to sixty k right now. What's the goal there? Let's say twelve months up.\nSpeaker 0: So, I mean, I I would love a hundred thousand months. Hundred thousand dollar months would be amazing. And we've been steadily growing. You know, there's there were I would say, honestly, like, COVID is really wet. Boosted our revenue.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely.\nSpeaker 0: It was it was it's not a great thing to go through, but it was a great thing business wise in this industry as you know. So it and it continues to grow. So, yeah, a hundred thousand dollar months are are my goal and anything above that is, you know, icing.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.", "doc_id": "932ffdd6-516e-4324-99dc-c51c0c3527aa", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6fed4485401852c521bc65146ee599e6852d527341cafc999850c50f9ffe1bf0", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 3745, "end": 7501, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96620b77-5138-4a95-9e7f-44be8ede378e", "2": "d2bd115a-2343-4af7-856c-956e792ed5dc", "3": "b06662e6-cb6b-403f-9151-91f29ab9fda0"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "b06662e6-cb6b-403f-9151-91f29ab9fda0": {"__data__": {"text": "my goal and anything above that is, you know, icing.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. It's a great call. Great. Cool. So we wanna go from forty to sixty k to hundred k a month. Yes. The only thing stopping from getting there is just signing more clients. And the only thing stopping from signing more clients is just speaking to enough qualified people that are, you know, willing to pay you on a month of, you know, yearly basis, annual contracts and then should be pretty straightforward.\nSpeaker 0: Exactly.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So on that, obviously, we need to get you speaking to the right people on a daily basis. Mhmm. What are those people? Who's the ideal client?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Great question. So these are typically gonna be corporate clients that It's a variety, honestly. So I'll give you some examples of clients. So we had we just finished our routine because they got bought out by a bunch of investors. But they were with us for five years. They were a an international hair product. And we did their social media marketing as well as Google Ads and their social media ads on Facebook and Instagram.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: So We also did, like, some YouTube video production stuff, and they were they were around between eight to ten grand a month was their retainer. So that's that's a client, physical products, e commerce, products. And then I also have a couple clients that are business consulting firms --\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: -- that within their firm, they have business coaches, online business coaches, and they have courses and masterminds and things like that. They have an internal sales team, and our job is to help them with their visibility, with their content marketing, so visibility on social media, including LinkedIn too, as well as, you know, video repurposing, blogging, Facebook and Instagram ads, lead generation through those avenues. So that's another type of client. We also have worked with mortgage companies that are looking for lead generation. So it's it's a variety I don't know if that helps, like, kinda pinned down. My favorite type of client to work with are the the business consultants. Mhmm. So high level business consultants that have teams that they the the business consultant themselves or business coach has a big organization. They are authors. They speak at conferences all over the world. They are looking for somebody or a company to handle their visibility and lead lead generation into their programs. That's my favorite type of clients to work with. But again, we also work with e commerce -- Yep. -- brands. So, yeah, does that help?\nSpeaker 1: It helps very much. So it can be e commerce. The ideal would be high level business consultants. Not the individuals, not the, you know, self employed, more the high level ones with teams potentially with an established brand online, authors, speakers, you know, people with that establishment. And you also have mortgage in terms of lead generation, but the high level business consultants, that would be a number one.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Absolutely. And And to expand on that a little bit, those high level business consultants that don't have a team are the ones that come into my mastermind.\nSpeaker 1: So you do have a down\nSpeaker 0: Because they right.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: So I have clients that have started in my mastermind and then figured out that, you know what, Gina? I actually need you guys to do everything for me, and they go up into the agency. And then I have and then I have clients. They come in thinking that they have the resources to hire us as their agency and then realize, okay. No. I don't have the resources, but I still wanna work with you. Bring me into your mastermind. And maybe they have a virtual assistant. Right? And I do allow one virtual assistant to come in with that. But it's more of a done with you. Mastermind, it's not done for you, like the agents. So there could be a lot of crossover.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. So you have a whole ecosystem around this. But even if someone can't qualify for the agency specifically, they", "doc_id": "b06662e6-cb6b-403f-9151-91f29ab9fda0", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "8f3904621240ff65b13949ac1f980a78e8209e3b6c32ff147a0426104cd0600d", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 7502, "end": 11592, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96620b77-5138-4a95-9e7f-44be8ede378e", "2": "932ffdd6-516e-4324-99dc-c51c0c3527aa", "3": "f7cc741c-f6ce-413f-8437-6594e85d9ec1"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "f7cc741c-f6ce-413f-8437-6594e85d9ec1": {"__data__": {"text": "around this. But even if someone can't qualify for the agency specifically, they can go to I'm with you master mine.\nSpeaker 0: Yep.\nSpeaker 1: That is perfect. Alright. So we have a clear idea of where you are. We wanna go forty to sixty k to around a hundred k per month. Based on most clients, that's very reasonable. And if we can just get you in contact with more high level business consultants with teams, the brand, all those speakers. I mean, you'll never be able to sell them. And even if you don't, sell them on the agency, you can sell them on the mastermind, which will be perfect. Mhmm. So right now, just in terms of your sales process, let's say you were to be able to generate leads consistently and bookings consistently, would you be taking a pause or would a sales rep or someone else be taking them?\nSpeaker 0: So right now, it would be me.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: Which my, you know, my meeting times are Some weeks are not easy, other weeks are more open. So but, yes, right now it's me.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect.\nSpeaker 0: And and I and I have and right now, I plan for the actual call to be me. That's part that's something that I have to work through with, like, letting go of some of that control. Now getting them to the call can be somebody else.\nSpeaker 1: Oh, yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: One hundred percent. But the actual call would be with me. Now there are, like, you know, to get them to the call, there's we do qualify them. Right? So sometimes I don't even like, I don't even we don't even offer the call. If we feel that they're just not the right fit, we'll send them to a resource or, you know, send them to somebody else that I know that might be a better fit for them. So I I would like obviously a lot of prequalifying before it gets to the point to get on a call with me.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent, like, your time is very valuable. Right. You can't be having get on every call. Alright. Perfect. And just so we can get some context as to what you've tried in the past? How are you currently impacting clients besides referrals, obviously?\nSpeaker 0: So I would have to say from networking. So I I do a lot of networking I host networking virtual events with higher level of people. Also, I am in my in my like for myself, I am in two really high level masterminds myself with business coaches. And inside of those programs, I get referred well, so it's the same thing, referrals. Just connecting with people that are, you know, at my same level. And I'm very visible online also, so I will get somebody that will see, like, one of my lives streams and then -- Mhmm. -- you know, say, hey, I know somebody who needs help, but again, that's a referral. So it's a lot it's word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth referrals. Typically. When people come into my mastermind, that's usually they'll come in because I do run ads for myself, but it's it's to get somebody to, like, a workshop. And then from there, we get on a call. Right? We we are or we have started to plan out to run Google ads for the agency. Like, within the next month or so. That's something that I had never I've never done because we just always got referrals. But I am I'm in I'm I'm ready to honestly sub up into this next level of hundred k months. So so that's something that we wanna try. But yeah, it's just mainly referrals and word-of-mouth for the agency.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. That is very good in the sense that you know, if you're growing from word-of-mouth, it's just it's always good because it's just a great indicator that people like what you do. They're referring to other people. And the fact I have a brand already online doing these live streams, not to get ahead of myself, but this is when you do start some sort of outbound or some sort of advertising. What we found is that the clients who have the", "doc_id": "f7cc741c-f6ce-413f-8437-6594e85d9ec1", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "a88870008387db61c0d4c6bf145213e8c3efd04bbb4069d149329c03e5d332a9", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11583, "end": 15399, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96620b77-5138-4a95-9e7f-44be8ede378e", "2": "b06662e6-cb6b-403f-9151-91f29ab9fda0", "3": "9b08fe1e-d6cf-4c75-8fc2-8e1abc158e70"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b08fe1e-d6cf-4c75-8fc2-8e1abc158e70": {"__data__": {"text": "of outbound or some sort of advertising. What we found is that the clients who have the brand, the content, these assets online, they get significantly better results when they do outbound with us via email, LinkedIn, Facebook, adds whatever it might be because it just adds that additional level of we call it external factors, but in the actual so you had a big advantage there. What I do wanna ask is, in terms of referrals, in terms of what amount, how predictable is the actual acquisition. How consistent of the clients are coming?\nSpeaker 0: It's not super consistent because Well, it's well, I would for a few different factors, I would say number one because my focus, you know, sometimes when we are, like, at capacity, for example, then I shift my focus to marketing more of my mastermind. Because that's where really my passion is is to be in there helping these entrepreneurs in a small group setting. And I've been comfortable I've just been comfortable with where we're at. But, like, this week, I had a I had a I have three people that reach out to me out of I say it's not out of the blue. It seems like it's out of the blue, but I know it's not. It's the things that I I do on a consistent basis by showing up that gets people to remember and then, you know, they start talking and from seeing my emails go out, things like that. But it's not like, I haven't we haven't set a process where I'm we're we're literally, like, contacting ten companies a week. And then from that, we know that we're gonna get this money sales calls and then from that, we're gonna get this many calls. For the agency, it hasn't worked that way. It works that way with my masterminds. I know if I wanna bring people in there, I have, like, leads. I've got tons of leads that I that I reach out to you on a weekly basis to have conversations with them to then get them in there. Before the agency, it just hasn't been that way because it's just referrals and then, you know, we we do well. So I've kind of been complacent about it --\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: -- for a bit, but I know that there's a lot of room for growth.\nSpeaker 1: Definitely. I mean, then based on that question, when are you actually looking to start moving towards a hundred k a month?\nSpeaker 0: I would say, like, June, like, literally, like, start getting things whatever processes need to be built out -- Yeah. -- like now, you know, with this month, and then we could as of June, start really focusing on that.\nSpeaker 1: Hundred percent. Because, I mean, honestly, you're doing pretty well and most people stand it. So The question always need to ask is actually when you're looking to do it or if you're looking to do it. Because if not\nSpeaker 0: Yes. Right. Yeah. I mean, yes. That is absolutely a goal. So how how does this work with what you guys offer?\nSpeaker 1: Sure. So, I mean, just to recap everything. It seems like like I was saying at the beginning, the biggest problem that you're facing is just you know, not having a predictable way of getting in front of your ideal prospects every single day.\nSpeaker 0: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 1: I think that can solve so many problems for you. In the sense that if you have this consistent inflow, you know how many people it takes to get on to a call that are converted to a client that would result in this revenue. You know, you can make the key hires, get salespeople on potentially, hire more people in the back end and then fully remove yourself from the actual agency. This is what we do with a lot of our clients. Now they're very involved in everything because they don't have that predictability. And once we have it, once they can step out of sales, step out of acquisition. They can focus on doing what they, you know, actually want to do. So if this is the case and you're like, obviously, ninety nine percent of our clients have seen great results So do you mind if I share just a little bit more information about what we do?\nSpeaker 0: Go", "doc_id": "9b08fe1e-d6cf-4c75-8fc2-8e1abc158e70", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "afdec6c4a664692f3e9e0a63a7d4bee0e6e353b017b31f2db1d3a7a5499400ce", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 15397, "end": 19372, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "96620b77-5138-4a95-9e7f-44be8ede378e", "2": "f7cc741c-f6ce-413f-8437-6594e85d9ec1", "3": "968faba3-d0cd-425d-979b-4d4ad5f82942"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "968faba3-d0cd-425d-979b-4d4ad5f82942": {"__data__": {"text": "if I share just a little bit more information about what we do?\nSpeaker 0: Go ahead. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. Cool. So, yeah, based on what you told me, like I said, you seem like a great fit. And Again, to give a quick overview, we help establish marketing agencies to increase revenue by around fifty thousand to one hundred thousand per month within six to nine months. And just to reiterate, the absolute biggest problem that we hope to solve is client acquisition. So, again, the agencies we work with, they have the systems. Right? They have the foundation. They have the understanding how to deliver. In your case, you have clients that stay on for four to five years. You've grown from referrals. You know, it's perfect. You have everything there. You have the brand. You have the content. Right? You just don't have the time to actually reach out to these people every single day because you're running a mask line and an agency. So I mean, based on that, that's the biggest problem we're helping to solve. Right? Getting in front of your ideal prospects every single day, So this would be high level business consultants with teams. And I mean, if that's the case, scale will be pretty much inevitable. I don't wanna call it easy. So I do think it will be easy, but people I should stop saying it's easy. But based on that, I'd love to share a bit more. Would you be able to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal for you on how I think we can help you reach hundred k month?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.

Will this time tomorrow with you?\nSpeaker 0: Tomorrow, I don't think so, but let me open let me open it up. Like, I'm somewhere tomorrow at one. So tell me a little bit about you really quick. How long have you been doing this?\nSpeaker 1: Good question. People don't usually ask that.\nSpeaker 0: Really?\nSpeaker 1: Yeah. Yeah. Not a not a common thing to ask. And if those times don't work, just let me know when I can send\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: But about me, like, a long time at this point, So our business currently is run by myself, and then I have a partner, desire. Right? He is the head of growth I'm the CEO of the company managing the entire team. We have about twelve people on board right now. Mhmm. And ninety percent of them are client focused who's helping to deliver results in terms of booking meetings, building the offer, making case study videos, helping with sales, things like that. I'll see going to a lot more detail on this tomorrow or whenever you can book India.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah.\nSpeaker 1: Those are entire process, but Yep. That's how about you?\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Give me a minute.\nSpeaker 0: So I asked actually and the other thing I was gonna ask you before I get inside. So where are you out of? Where are you located?\nSpeaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now. Partners in UK. Uh-huh. Yeah. And you?\nSpeaker 0: Okay. I'm in South Florida in the US.\nSpeaker 1: South Florida.\nSpeaker 0: Close to Miami.\nSpeaker 1: Yeah.\nSpeaker 0: That's like the bigger city around me. Okay. So tomorrow, you know what?

We've got a few new clients on. So getting them on board and got some new team members on too. That's been fun. How about you?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah, man. It's it's a busy day for me too.

No. It's yeah. I'm actually outside.\nSpeaker 1: That's great. That's great. I was looking forward to this conversation. I really wanted to see how we could potentially make something work If you're open to it, I can get us started with everything if you'd like.\nSpeaker 0: Go for it, brother.\nSpeaker 1: Easy, man. Alright. Cool. I was checking out your website. It looks like we're doing something relatively similar. I mean, how the calls usually go? I think, you know, I just wanna start off asking some quick questions. I'll be understanding where you are, where you wanna be. And if we could potentially partner, help you get there. And also explain all the steps how it works and then answer any questions that you might have afterwards. Is that okay with you?\nSpeaker 0: Go for, man.\nSpeaker 1: Cool, man. Alright. So Dave, this place is start. What made you wanna take this call?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So it's actually for two of my other companies. So I'm with seven different companies. Avadel, which is the STR company. I'm actually selling that. And so I'm looking for some new appointment setters to be working with me. So the two brands that I'm looking to grow, one is called DHS. They do It's a graphic design and branding agency. They do unlimited design work. Mhmm. And so, literally, you pay them a flat fee. They'll do as many designs as you want within a month. And then the other one is called the drew agency quest. And so I've owned four different agencies, stole some, and I basically teach agency owners how to grow their agency and then be a hands off CEO. So like, hey, man. I don't have to do anything. I don't have to take sales calls. I don't have to do any of that kind of stuff. So allowing people to kinda like work into a space of freedom is what I do with those people. So for the Dream Agency Quest, the target agency owners that are doing two hundred thousand to one point five million in U. S. Dollar revenue in a year. And then with the VHS stuff, man, we work with pretty much companies that have twenty two upwards of five hundred employees. Consumer product goods are huge for us over there. Any kind of b to b service is big because they'll like handy to slide deck for the sales team. I need a PDF. I need Mhmm. So anything like that would also be great for that. So those are the two things that I looked for now.\nSpeaker 1: That's amazing. That's amazing. Just to recap, making sure I heard everything correctly, you can run seven companies right now. It's very impressive. And you're looking to grow firstly BHS. That's a branding and graphic design agency. Right. And then you're also looking to scale dream agency question. This is mainly towards agency owners helping them transition from working in the business doing all the day to day things to transition to really work on the business, you know, potentially stepping out, having it run by self automating system systemizing things. And the goal is to bypass the both of those.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. That'd be great.\nSpeaker 1: That's fantastic.

And out of the two, is there a priority as to which one you look to scale more or is it like a fifty fifty thing?\nSpeaker 0: It's fifth to fifth thing, man. They're they're both they're both high ticket offers. And Yeah. They've they've got a lot of potential to grow and and kind of the way that they're both set up is we can work with anybody in the world on either one of those offers. So lots of lots of room and space to engage with people.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Oh, this is great. Okay. Cool. So just so we can put a number on it. Obviously, your goals scale it up. Let's say twelve months out, where you guys looking to get it.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So for BHS, So their starting baseline package, which is like a standard package for everybody, is five k a month. Mhmm. We'd love to by the end of this year, we'd love to have twenty or thirty of more of those clients. And then with the dream agency quest, man, we're we're looking to build a a community of agency owners. We've already got a number of people that are in on it. But we'd love to add another fifty to a hundred students to cohorts. Between now and this time next year. Really a hundred by this time next year would be ideal.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. So BHS, you charge around five k a month. The goal is to add an extra twenty to thirty clients. That would put you, you know, adding an extra hundred to format is correct, hundred and fifty thousand per month. And the agent's request, that's fifty to a hundred extra students.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. And so the way that that works, we kinda have two models. So one model is they they they finance a year. So your engagement is eighteen k, or they do a three year engagement. We give them all sorts of gear TEs and extra bonuses and stuff. We actually have a financing partner, but they only work inside the US. Mhmm. But that financing partner would make it so that they base we have the ability to finance the thirty five thousand upfront. So they get two years for the or they get three years for the price of two in that model.\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. Perfect. So it's around eighteen thousand for one year being accessed or getting access to community, the training, mentorship, things like that. Yep. Yep. That's it, man. Alright. That's cool. That's really cool. Alright. Cool. So just to recap, the goal would be to add around an for a hundred to a hundred and fifty to BHS. And for frame agency quests, there'll be around fifty to a hundred students at eighteen thousand per year. Alright? Nice. Okay. Cool. So for BHS, how far you guys from you know I mean, obviously, the goal is to add extra hundred to hundred and fifty weigh you guys right now. Oh, establishes it.\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. It's pretty established, man. So this is some remnants of a previous agency -- Mhmm. -- that I I owned. And so I when I sold that previous agency, there were some clients that they wanted to stick around. So I carved them out whenever we did the the agreement with the the buyer. And brought a designer with me, and she has become my partner. And so right now in that model, DHS is serving twelve different clients. So about sixty grand a month. And we are looking to scale it up, man, and kind of convert it into an even bigger agency because we've figured out systems processes, you know, way to way to get it down and really do it well. And so yeah, man. So we're looking to to grow that thing.\nSpeaker 1: I could Okay. That's perfect. So I mean, it's definitely not the case of you not knowing how to grow a business. You clearly have all the foundations there. You have the systems. You have the process. You probably have the team already. Probably done a case studies too.

I've got I've got a a head of sales that helps me with both VHS and the Dream Agency Quest stuff. So he and I tag team some of those calls. He's priority. So he takes all the meetings that he can. And then I am secondary on backup. Right? So so basically, what we're doing, Ethan, is Yeah. So we're looking to grow those just by booking more meetings, and that's that's really the thing.\nSpeaker 1: That's perfect. Yeah. I mean, it seems don't wanna say easy. I don't say that too often, but it seems very straightforward. It seems very simple. Right? We just need to help\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: It's straightforward. The only thing starts at adding more clients speaking to an out prospects. Alright. Perfect. So one of the last things I just wanna ask is just to get an idea of what you're currently doing. So in terms of attracting clients right now, what systems do you have in in process or in place to actually do that?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So the STR agency that I own, they are almost exclusively a cold email agency. And so that's how they're generating leads for themselves and for all the five of the other six companies that I own. And they do a good job with it, man. But what we're looking to do is is more stuff like what I experience through your appointment center, which is one to one marketing where we're having conversations via social media. And engaging in that space. We're just seeing we've been trying that out.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: And we're seeing that it's really, really effective. And guys just happened to hit me up at the right time and we're having a conversation, man.\nSpeaker 1: So Right guy at the right time. It's almost like his intention is\nSpeaker 0: it, man. That's right.\nSpeaker 1: That's great. And I also think, just on that point, what we're finding for because we have a lot of clients doing similar things And -- Okay.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: what I'm finding is that the ones who get the best results have the best results. So with the three major quest, having that, like, reservoir of students and their results that can be used as quoted on the page for the one to one marketing is incredibly useful. Because if they do have any concerns, it's like, I hear you. But we help twelve other agency owners doing the exact same service and the exact same niche. And here's the test. Honestly, it's like, it's a new brainer, so that's perfect. Alright. Cool. I love it then. So the SDR agency is your main traffic source for these right now, and that's almost exclusively cold email marketing. On average, how many bookings are you getting per day for that?\nSpeaker 0: Yeah. So right now, for Dream Agency Quest, we're having, like, two a day for VHS. We're having two to three a day. Mhmm. But we would like to see those numbers increase. So we figured out a while ago, like, Giv, who's my head of sales. He can take twenty five to thirty meetings a week. No problem. And then I could do the same. If if we need to. So that's kinda what we are aiming to do, man.\nSpeaker 1: That's both. That's what I like to hear because a lot of the agencies that we have, they may be relatively smaller, but what we find is that they're the only ones taking the calls. So when we do get the initial inflow, it's like, great. This is amazing. Keep going. Okay. Now we're fully booked. Gotta stop everything. It's like, guys. We just stop We we could\nSpeaker 0: yeah. We could take fifty meetings a week, man.

We could take fifty meetings a week, man. No problem.\nSpeaker 1: That is perfect. Alright. Cool. That's great to hear. And besides email, is there anything else that you guys are leveraging?\nSpeaker 0: We've we've done some direct mail, so, like, sending physical items in the mail. Yeah. And we've we've had some success with that as well. We'll we'll probably keep doing that all still. We have a good relationship with a vendor that will engage with us on that. So Yeah, man.\nSpeaker 1: That's cool. And honestly, the the last thing that I wanted to ask is I know that your goal is to leverage the, you know, one to one marketing having the conversations by potentially social media, whatever it might be. Why do you actually wanna make that transition as opposed to just, for example, scaling up the email campaigns?\nSpeaker 0: Well, I mean, a big reason for this this push is we are selling off the SDR firm. And so as part of my non compete, I'm not going to be able to to run those anymore even for myself, which is fine. But the other thing that we've noticed to Ethan is when you're doing cold email outreach, you're always fighting with deliverability. Mhmm. And so and and you can do things that will make it work But to get it to scale, it it it poses challenges. And so we're looking for new ways to stand out. One of the other things that have a two d thing in that industry, one of the reasons that led me to sell -- Yeah. -- is that there's a lot of people that have entered into that market. And so when I got into it, when I sold my first agency and then started the SDR firm, that was August of twenty nineteen. There wasn't anyone in that space, ma'am.\nSpeaker 1: Mhmm.\nSpeaker 0: I mean, there were there were people in that space So there were not a lot of people in that space. And so yeah, man. So we're just trying to flip up the game here a little bit and and find something new and fresh that people have not saturated, and they haven't been saturated the one to one marketing space yet.\nSpeaker 1: Absolutely. And Just a quick note that what what we'd be noticing, what you said about deliverability is completely right. It's almost like with email, the more you do, the more difficult it becomes, just with the deliverability. Right. But with Instagram or Facebook, the more you do the easier it gets because of the components -- Right.\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: holding your network and the content and the social group, everything there. So by focusing on the, you know, the social platform, you get a a lot more leverage as opposed to just messing a new prospect every day. Yeah. And I'd love to go into more detail because we actually leverage the two together. Right?\nSpeaker 0: So beautiful.\nSpeaker 1: Use yeah. So using the the speed and the volume that you can get from the outbound email. Combine that with the, like, the social aspects, the content, the the leverage, the being able to make one post and a piece seen by a thousand people. So, I mean, based on this, it seems like the biggest problem you're facing right now is just adding more clients. Right? To go from way up to way you wanna be adding extra hundred, hundred and fifty per month and signing the students. It's just a matter of signing more clients. And The only thing stopping from signing more clients\nSpeaker 0: is it, man.\nSpeaker 1: More people. Right? You guys can definitely close. So that's the case, and I guess you're, like, ninety nine. That's all clients. So do you mind if I share some info what the next steps would be?\nSpeaker 0: Go for it, man.\nSpeaker 1: Cool. So again, based on what you told me, you seem like a a great fit. And to give a quick overview of what we do, you know, we typically partner with established marketing agencies. To help increase revenue by fifty hundred k per month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to", "doc_id": "99eca743-be35-480d-a1c4-1e62fd3b021a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "500a5bb85671860f85d14f88d916164c9442f5aeebc098964a04f893e06f0d4c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 11348, "end": 15260, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "c557cec5-ca8e-4293-a4ca-8d24f66847c8", "2": "6e5207b1-362d-424a-9268-7c0c69c8fdd1", "3": "1b8cef51-b253-424d-a582-7988660025b4"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "1b8cef51-b253-424d-a582-7988660025b4": {"__data__": {"text": "per month within around sixty nine months. And the absolute biggest problem that we help them to solve is client acquisition. Right, across the board, across every niche, across every industry, is just being able to create a system that predictably and reliably brings in new clients. Right? You clearly have all the foundations in place. You know you run seven businesses. So you know how to build it. You know how to structure it. You know how to implement the systems, the process of the team. And you have all the results, you have the testimonials, the social proof. It's just a matter of getting in contact with more of them. Like, that is literally it. So if we can do that, then scale will be pretty much inevitable. Right? And like I was saying, we like to leverage a combination of you know, direct messaging through email. That gets us a ton of volume, a ton of scale, but also leveraging this with ways that you can actually bold your brand and have that compounding effect in terms of posting content, building up your audience, and actually owning the audience in the first place so you can leverage that over and over. So based on that, Would you be open to scheduling a follow-up call where I can create a customized proposal on exactly what I, you know, mentioned today, what we spoke about?\nSpeaker 0: Sure, ma'am.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Alright. Well, I'm just gonna bring up my calendar and we'll see if there's any good times. Would tomorrow, but an hour later work here.\nSpeaker 0: No. I've got meetings going until I've got meetings going until five thirty eastern time tomorrow.\nSpeaker 1: Got it. Okay. What I'll do is I will send over a scheduling link. So we don't have to -- Oh. -- battleship with our calendar, and then\nSpeaker 0: --\nSpeaker 1: Perfect. -- secure those time book. And if they don't, I'll just move some things around here. Alright. Cool.\nSpeaker 0: Cool, man. I think that probably my next best available will be Friday, honestly. Do you have anything in there?\nSpeaker 1: At this point, these meetings every day, but Hopefully, some of these times work. That's fine. Cool. Perfect. Just let me know if they don't work. Yeah, man. Let me see what you got.\nSpeaker 0: So I'm gonna be in Pacific Time on Friday. Mhmm. Do you have anything later? Because the the latest one that I see in there is four thirty AM. K.\nSpeaker 1: Fair enough. Yeah. I can free some up here. I'll just adjust the\nSpeaker 0: I'll get up early because where where are you at, Ethan?\nSpeaker 1: I'm in Cape Town right now.\nSpeaker 0: Oh, beautiful, man. Yeah, dude. If I need to get up earlier just to be able to kinda not make you stay up super late? I'm down to do that, man.\nSpeaker 1: We can definitely meet the middle. I'm happy to stay up. It's not a problem. Alright. Let's see.\nSpeaker 0: Okay.\nSpeaker 1: Okay. How about this one? Give me the middle.\nSpeaker 0: Perfect. These are these are great. Let's do this right here, man. Alright, man. Just scheduled for nine AM Pacific Friday.\nSpeaker 1: Imagined. Alright. Dave, it was an absolute pleasure speaking and to just give some contact while back. Between now and Friday, Either myself or someone else and the team will reach out, just confirm everything, check out this call went probably. And then on that call, what we'll do is we'll firstly go through a kind of case studies of other agencies that we have. Our exact process for getting these results would recommend, and then all the additional details like how to get started, things like that afterwards. Okay with you?\nSpeaker 0: Sounds great, man.\nSpeaker 1: Amazing. Dave was amazing speaking, and I'll talk to you very soon.\nSpeaker 0: Likewise, bro.
